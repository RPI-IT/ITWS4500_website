## Reading & Tutorial Assignment
Complete these tutorials before Week 6. This is a hands-on week — work through the tutorials at your own pace, but aim to complete all three.

## Introduction

This week we shift focus from backend architecture to building a **solid foundation in React and Next.js**. Many of you have been generating code with AI tools — which is great for productivity — but to debug, modify, and make architectural decisions, you need to understand what that code is doing.

The Lab 4 solution demonstrates four implementations of the same application using different combinations of React, Next.js, Express, and MongoDB. This week's tutorials will help you understand the core concepts behind those implementations.

## Tutorial 1: React Quick Start

**Source:** [react.dev/learn](https://react.dev/learn)

**Estimated time:** 60-90 minutes

This is the official React tutorial and the best place to start. It covers:

- **Creating and nesting components** — React apps are built from components, which are JavaScript functions that return markup
- **Writing markup with JSX** — the HTML-like syntax used inside React components
- **Adding styles** — how CSS works with React components
- **Displaying data** — using curly braces `{}` to embed JavaScript in JSX
- **Conditional rendering** — showing different content based on conditions
- **Rendering lists** — using `.map()` to transform arrays into elements
- **Responding to events** — handling clicks, form submissions, and other user interactions
- **Updating the screen** — using `useState` to manage data that changes
- **Using hooks** — built-in functions like `useState` and `useEffect`
- **Sharing data between components** — lifting state up to parent components

### How This Connects to Lab 4

As you work through the React tutorial, notice how every concept appears in the Lab 4 solution:

| React Concept | Lab 4 Example |
|--------------|---------------|
| Components | `ProjectCard`, `ProjectList`, `TaskList`, `ProjectForm` |
| Props | `<ProjectCard project={p} />` |
| State (`useState`) | `const [projects, setProjects] = useState([])` |
| Effects (`useEffect`) | Data fetching on component mount |
| Event handling | Form submissions, delete confirmations |
| Conditional rendering | Loading spinners, error messages, empty states |
| List rendering | `projects.map(p => <ProjectCard key={p._id} ... />)` |

## Tutorial 2: React Foundations Course

**Source:** [nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations](https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations)

**Estimated time:** 45-60 minutes

This Next.js-authored course bridges the gap between vanilla JavaScript, React, and Next.js. It covers:

- **From JavaScript to React** — why React exists and what problems it solves
- **Building UI with components** — the component mental model
- **Displaying data with props** — passing information between components
- **Adding interactivity with state** — making components dynamic
- **From React to Next.js** — what a framework adds on top of a library
- **Server and Client Components** — the key Next.js concept

### Key Concept: Server vs. Client Components

This tutorial introduces a critical distinction:

- **Server Components** (default in Next.js) — render on the server, send HTML to the browser. Better performance, smaller bundles, can access databases directly.
- **Client Components** (`'use client'`) — render in the browser. Required for interactivity: `useState`, `useEffect`, `onClick`, browser APIs.

In the Lab 4 solution:
- `react-only` and `react-express-mongo` — everything is client-side (no server rendering)
- `react-nextjs-mongo` and `react-next-express-mongo` — uses both Server and Client Components

## Tutorial 3: Next.js Dashboard App

**Source:** [nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app)

**Estimated time:** 3-5 hours (can be done over multiple sessions)

This is the comprehensive Next.js tutorial that builds a full dashboard application. It covers:

1. **Getting started** — project setup and structure
2. **CSS styling** — different styling approaches in Next.js
3. **Optimizing fonts and images** — Next.js built-in optimizations
4. **Creating layouts and pages** — file-based routing and nested layouts
5. **Navigating between pages** — the `<Link>` component and client-side navigation
6. **Setting up your database** — connecting to a database
7. **Fetching data** — server-side data fetching patterns
8. **Static and dynamic rendering** — when content is generated
9. **Streaming** — progressive loading with Suspense
10. **Partial prerendering** — combining static and dynamic content
11. **Adding search and pagination** — URL-based state with search params
12. **Mutating data** — Server Actions for data modifications
13. **Handling errors** — error boundaries and error handling
14. **Improving accessibility** — form validation and accessibility
15. **Adding authentication** — NextAuth.js integration
16. **Adding metadata** — SEO optimization

### How This Connects to Lab 4

| Dashboard Tutorial Chapter | Lab 4 Equivalent |
|---------------------------|-------------------|
| Layouts and Pages | `layout.js` and `page.js` in Next.js variants |
| Navigating Between Pages | `<Link>` component usage |
| Fetching Data | `useEffect` + `fetch` in client components, API routes |
| Mutating Data | Form submissions to create/update/delete projects |
| Handling Errors | Error states in components, try/catch in API calls |
| Adding Authentication | (Preview of Lab 6) |

## Understanding the Four Architectures

As you work through the tutorials, keep the Lab 4 solution architectures in mind:

### Architecture 1: React Only (No Server)
```
Browser → React Components → localStorage
```
- All tutorials from react.dev apply directly
- No server concepts (no Server Components, no API routes)

### Architecture 2: React + Express + MongoDB
```
Browser → React Components → fetch() → Express API → MongoDB
```
- React tutorials apply to the frontend
- Express handles the backend (separate from React)
- Cross-origin requests require CORS

### Architecture 3: Next.js + MongoDB
```
Browser → Next.js (React + Routing + API Routes) → MongoDB
```
- All three tutorials apply
- Server and Client Components from React Foundations
- API routes and data fetching from Dashboard App

### Architecture 4: Next.js + Express + MongoDB
```
Browser → Next.js (React + Routing) → Express API → MongoDB
```
- Next.js handles frontend only
- Express handles backend (like Architecture 2)
- Combines Next.js routing with standalone API

## Key Terms

- **Component** — A reusable piece of UI, defined as a JavaScript function returning JSX
- **JSX** — A syntax extension that lets you write HTML-like markup in JavaScript
- **Props** — Read-only data passed from parent to child components
- **State** — Data managed within a component that can change over time
- **Hook** — A special function (`useState`, `useEffect`) that lets components use React features
- **Side Effect** — An operation that affects something outside the component (data fetching, DOM manipulation)
- **Server Component** — A Next.js component that renders on the server (default)
- **Client Component** — A Next.js component marked with `'use client'` that renders in the browser
- **File-based Routing** — Next.js convention where the file system structure defines URL routes
- **API Route Handler** — A Next.js file (`route.js`) that handles HTTP requests like a backend endpoint

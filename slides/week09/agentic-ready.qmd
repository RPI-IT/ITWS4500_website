# A Quick Reality Check {.section-slide background-color="#d6001c"}

## AI Is Already Here

You've probably already used AI today:

- Searched for something online
- Got a recommendation on Netflix or Spotify
- Used autocomplete in email
- Asked ChatGPT a question

. . .

> The question isn't whether AI will affect your career.
> It's **how you'll learn to work with it**.

# Two Types of AI {.section-slide background-color="#d6001c"}

Understanding the difference matters for your career

## Generative AI: The Content Creator

**What it does:** Creates new content based on patterns it learned

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Examples:**

- ChatGPT writing an email
- DALL-E creating an image
- Copilot suggesting code
- Claude summarizing a document
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Key characteristic:**

You ask → It answers

One input, one output

You remain in control of every step
:::

::::

## Agentic AI: The Autonomous Worker

**What it does:** Plans, decides, takes actions, and adapts

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Examples:**

- AI that researches competitors and writes a report
- AI that books your travel across multiple sites
- AI that monitors inventory and reorders supplies
- AI that debugs code and fixes it autonomously
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Key characteristic:**

You set a goal → It figures out how

Multiple steps, decisions along the way

Works semi-autonomously
:::

::::

## The Key Difference

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    subgraph Generative["Generative AI"]
        A["Human Request"] --> B["AI Response"]
    end

    subgraph Agentic["Agentic AI"]
        C["Human Goal"] --> D["AI Plans"]
        D --> E["AI Acts"]
        E --> F["AI Evaluates"]
        F --> G["AI Adapts"]
        G --> E
    end
```

. . .

Generative AI is a **tool**.
Agentic AI is a **collaborator**.

# Why This Matters for Business {.section-slide background-color="#d6001c"}

## The Productivity Multiplier

Traditional workflow:
```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    A["Analyst"] --> B["Manager Reviews"]
    B --> C["Revisions"]
    C --> D["More Reviews"]
    D --> E["Final Output"]
```

. . .

AI-augmented workflow:
```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    A["Human + AI Agent"] --> B["Draft + Analysis"]
    B --> C["Human Judgment"]
    C --> D["Final Output"]
```

## Real Examples Today

| Function | Traditional | With Agentic AI |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Market Research | Weeks of analyst work | Hours with human oversight |
| Code Development | Write every line | Describe what you want, review output |
| Customer Service | Human answers each query | AI handles routine, humans handle complex |
| Financial Analysis | Build models manually | AI builds, human validates |

## The "10x" Effect

Studies are showing dramatic productivity gains:

- **Consultants:** 25-40% faster on complex tasks with AI assistance
- **Programmers:** 55% faster code completion with AI tools
- **Customer service:** 14% more issues resolved per hour
- **Writing tasks:** 40% improvement in quality for average performers

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
**The key insight:** AI doesn't replace thinking. It amplifies it.
:::

# The Empowered Consultant {.section-slide background-color="#d6001c"}

A new model for knowledge work

## What Is an Empowered Consultant?

Someone who can:

- **Understand business problems** deeply
- **Direct AI systems** to gather information and create outputs
- **Evaluate and refine** AI-generated work
- **Make judgment calls** that require human insight

. . .

> You don't need to code everything yourself.
> You need to **manage AI that can code for you**.

## The Rise of "Vibe Coding"

**Vibe coding:** Describing what you want in plain language and having AI build it

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Before:**

"I need to learn React, CSS, database design, API development, deployment..."

*Months of learning before building anything*
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Now:**

"Build me a dashboard that shows sales by region with filters for date range and product category"

*Working prototype in hours*
:::

::::

. . .

**The catch:** You still need to know enough to evaluate whether it's good.

## What "Managing AI" Looks Like

1. **Framing the problem** — AI can't solve problems you can't articulate
2. **Breaking down complex tasks** — Knowing what steps are needed
3. **Providing context** — AI works better with good information
4. **Quality control** — Catching errors, biases, and gaps
5. **Iterating** — Refining outputs through feedback

. . .

::: {.callout-important}
The person who can do this well is **extremely productive**.

- **Compliance monitoring** in real-time
- **Financial modeling** with scenario analysis

. . .

**Example:** AI agents that prepare monthly close materials and flag issues

## Marketing & Sales

- **Personalization** at individual customer level
- **Content generation** across channels
- **Lead scoring** and prioritization
- **Competitive intelligence** gathering

. . .

**Example:** AI agents that research prospects before sales calls

## Product Development

- **Code generation** and debugging
- **Testing automation**
- **Documentation** creation
- **Design iteration** based on user feedback

. . .

**Example:** AI agents that can build functional prototypes from descriptions

# Rethinking Education {.section-slide background-color="#d6001c"}

How we're preparing students differently

## The Old Model: Build Up Slowly

Traditional approach:

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    A["Foundations"] --> B["Intermediate Skills"]
    B --> C["Advanced Techniques"]
    C --> D["Real Projects"]
    D --> E["Impact"]
```

. . .

**Problem:** Years of "building blocks" before doing anything meaningful

## The New Model: Skip the Middle

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    A["Foundations"] --> B["AI Handles the Middle"]
    B --> C["Real Impact"]

    style B fill:#d6001c,color:#fff
```

. . .

**AI lets students focus on:**

- **Foundations** — Understanding *why* and *what*, not just *how*
- **High-impact contexts** — Real projects, real stakeholders, real decisions

## What We Mean by "Skip the Middle"

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**The Middle (AI can help):**

- Boilerplate code
- Syntax memorization
- Routine debugging
- Standard implementations
- Documentation formatting
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**The Ends (humans must own):**

- Problem understanding
- Architectural decisions
- User needs
- Quality judgment
- Ethical considerations
:::

::::

. . .

> Students spend time on **thinking**, not **typing**.

## Case Study: ITWS-4500

In our Advanced Web & Agentic AI course, students:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Week 1:**

- Form teams
- Identify a real problem
- Find an actual stakeholder
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**By Midterm:**

- Working prototype deployed
- Real users testing it
- Iterating based on feedback
:::

::::

. . .

**How?** AI accelerates the implementation so students focus on impact.

## Student Projects: Real Problems, Real Impact

Students build for **actual stakeholders**:

- **Startup ideas** they could launch
- **External organizations** — clubs, nonprofits, local businesses
- **Social impact** — addressing real community challenges

. . .

Examples of what students build:

- Inventory systems for campus organizations
- Scheduling tools for community groups
- Analytics dashboards for local nonprofits
- Prototype products for their own ventures

## What This Looks Like in Practice

A student team building an app for a local nonprofit:

| Task | Traditional | With AI |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Database schema | Days learning SQL | Describe needs, review generated schema |
| API endpoints | Week of coding | Describe functionality, refine output |
| Frontend UI | Another week | Describe layout, iterate quickly |
| **Focus shifts to:** | Syntax, debugging | User research, stakeholder feedback, real impact |

. . .

**Result:** Students deliver more value in less time

## The Educational Advantage

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Students learn:**

- How to direct AI effectively
- When to trust vs. verify output
- Architectural thinking
- Real stakeholder management
- Shipping actual products
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Students avoid:**

- Months of prerequisites before building
- Frustration with syntax errors
- Losing sight of the goal
- Building toys instead of tools
:::

::::

. . .

> They graduate having **built real things** for **real people**.

# Skills for the AI Economy {.section-slide background-color="#d6001c"}

## Technical Fluency (Not Expertise)

You don't need to be a computer scientist. You need to:

- Understand what AI **can and cannot** do
- Know how to **prompt** effectively
- Recognize **good vs. bad** AI output
- Understand basic **data concepts**

. . .

> Think: "Fluent tourist" not "native speaker"

## Strategic Thinking

AI handles execution. Humans handle:

- **Problem definition** — What are we actually trying to solve?
- **Trade-off analysis** — What are we optimizing for?
- **Ethical judgment** — Should we do this?
- **Stakeholder management** — Who is affected?

## Domain Expertise

AI is general. Value comes from **specificity**:

- Deep knowledge of an industry
- Understanding of customer needs
- Regulatory and compliance awareness
- Organizational context

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
**The formula:** Domain Expertise + AI Fluency = Competitive Advantage
:::

## The Skills That Are Hard to Automate

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Human advantages:**

- Building trust and relationships
- Navigating ambiguity
- Creative problem framing
- Ethical reasoning
- Cross-functional collaboration
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**AI advantages:**

- Processing large amounts of information
- Consistency at scale
- Pattern recognition
- Speed of execution
- Never getting tired
:::

::::

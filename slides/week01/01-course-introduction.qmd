# Course Overview {.section-slide background-color="#d6001c"}

## Why This Course?

> Build **production-quality** applications as **integrated systems**.

. . .

This is not only about writing code. We’ll focus on:

- **Architecture** — how systems are structured and why
- **Patterns** — reusable solutions to common problems
- **Trade-offs** — choosing “good defaults” and knowing when to change them
- **Integration** — making components work together
- **Operations** — deploying, monitoring, and evolving systems

## Big Idea: Patterns Outlast Tools

Tools and frameworks change quickly.

. . .


Patterns stick around:

- Client ↔ server communication
- Authentication and sessions
- Data modeling and persistence
- Scaling and reliability
- Dev workflows and deployment

## The Full-Stack View

. . .

We’ll revisit this diagram all semester and add details as your systems grow.

# Client Patterns: Web vs Mobile

## Web Applications

Common pattern:

- Browser UI (React, Vue, etc.)
- Communicates over **HTTP/HTTPS**
- Mostly **stateless** requests

Typical concerns:

- Routing
- Authentication
- State management
- Performance (latency, bundle size)

. . .

## Mobile Applications

Common pattern:

- Native or cross-platform app
- Often the **same backend** as the web app
- More constraints (battery, offline use, flaky networks)

::: {.callout-box}
**Key takeaway:** Web and mobile usually share the same backend.
:::

# Backend Patterns

## API-Centered Design

Most systems revolve around APIs:

- REST (common default)
- GraphQL (when it fits)

Typical responsibilities:

- Authentication & authorization
- Business logic
- Validation & error handling

. . .

## Service Organization

You’ll commonly see:

- **Monolith** — everything in one deployable
- **Modular monolith** — one deployable, clean internal boundaries
- **Microservices** — multiple deployables, more coordination

::: {.callout-box .warning}
**Rule of thumb:** Start simple; add distribution when you have clear reasons.
:::

# Data Patterns

## Databases (Common Choices)

- Relational: PostgreSQL, MySQL
- Document: MongoDB

. . .

## What Matters More Than the Brand

- Data modeling (entities, relationships, constraints)
- Indexing and query patterns
- Security (least privilege, injection prevention)
- Migrations and change management

## Data Access Pattern

Application → Data access layer → Database

# Infrastructure & Deployment Patterns

## From Laptop to Cloud

A common progression:
1. Local development
2. Containers (Docker)
3. Cloud deployment

. . .

## Infrastructure as Code

Instead of manual setup:

- Configuration files
- Repeatable environments
- Version-controlled deployments

If it can’t be reproduced, it’s not done.

# AI-Assisted Development

## The New Reality

Modern developers use AI to:

- Generate boilerplate
- Explore unfamiliar stacks
- Debug and refactor faster

. . .

## The Catch

> AI is most useful when you understand the underlying patterns.

This course will help you **ask better questions** and evaluate AI output critically.

# How This Course Flows {.section-slide background-color="#d6001c"}

## Patterns → Tools → Systems

We will move from:

- Concepts and patterns
- To implementation and integration
- To deployment and operations

. . .

## Coming Up

- Web & API architectures
- Databases and persistence
- Docker and deployment
- Multi-service systems

# Expectations

- You do not need to know every tool in advance
- You *do* need to think clearly about design choices
- Focus on the **why** behind decisions

. . .

::: {.callout-box .warning}
**Your job this semester:** build something real, learn patterns, explain trade-offs.

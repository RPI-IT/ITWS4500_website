# Midterm Presentations {.section-slide background-color="#d6001c"}

Demonstrating Architectural Understanding

## Today's Agenda

::: {.learning-objectives}
#### Session Goals

1. Review **presentation requirements** and evaluation criteria
2. Discuss **effective technical presentations**
3. **Team presentations** (10-15 minutes each)
4. **Q&A and feedback** after each presentation
:::

## What We're Looking For

The midterm is your opportunity to demonstrate:

- Understanding of **architectural concepts** from weeks 1-6
- Ability to make and justify **technical decisions**
- Clear communication of **trade-offs**
- Working **implementation** of your project

# Presentation Guidelines {.section-slide background-color="#d6001c"}

## Required Sections

Each presentation must cover:

| Section | Time | Content |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Project Overview** | 2 min | Problem, users, core features |
| **Architecture** | 5-7 min | System design, key decisions, ADRs |
| **Demo** | 3-5 min | Working features, data flow |
| **Lessons Learned** | 2-3 min | Challenges, insights, next steps |

**Total: 10-15 minutes** + 5 minutes Q&A

## Section 1: Project Overview

**2 minutes**

Cover these points:

- What **problem** are you solving?
- Who are your **target users**?
- What are the **core features** (MVP)?
- What makes your solution **valuable**?

. . .

::: {.callout-tip}
Don't spend too long here—we know your projects from the proposals. Focus on any evolution since then.
:::

## Section 2: Architecture Deep Dive

**5-7 minutes** (most important section)

Present 2-3 **Architectural Decision Records**:

```markdown
# ADR-001: [Decision Title]

## Context
What situation required a decision?

## Decision
What did you choose?

## Consequences
- Positive: What improved?
- Negative: What trade-offs did you accept?
- Risks: What could go wrong?

## Alternatives Considered
What else did you evaluate and why was it rejected?
```

## Example ADR Presentation

> **ADR-001: Use Zustand for State Management**
>
> **Context:** Our app has complex cart state shared across many components. We needed a solution that avoided prop drilling and re-render issues.
>
> **Decision:** We chose Zustand over Context API and Redux.
>
> **Why not Context?** Context causes re-renders of all consumers on any state change. With our cart updating frequently, this caused performance issues.
>
> **Why not Redux?** Too much boilerplate for our team size and timeline. Redux Toolkit helped, but Zustand was simpler.
>
> **Trade-off:** Less ecosystem (middleware, devtools) than Redux, but acceptable for our scope.

```

## Section 3: Live Demo

**3-5 minutes**

Demonstrate:

- **Core user flow** (most important feature)
- **Data persistence** (show data in MongoDB)
- **Architecture in action** (how layers interact)

. . .

::: {.callout-warning}
### Demo Tips

- Have a backup plan (screenshots, video)
- Pre-load data to avoid empty states
- Test your demo environment before presenting
- Keep it focused—don't show everything
:::

## Section 4: Lessons Learned

**2-3 minutes**

Reflect honestly on:

- What **worked well**?
- What would you do **differently**?
- What **challenges** remain?
- What are your **next steps**?

. . .

This section shows **maturity**—we're not expecting perfection!

# Evaluation Criteria {.section-slide background-color="#d6001c"}

## Grading Rubric

| Criteria | Weight | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Architecture Understanding** | 30% | Clear explanation of patterns, layers, decisions |
| **Decision Quality** | 25% | Well-reasoned ADRs with trade-off analysis |
| **Implementation** | 20% | Working demo, code quality, structure |
| **Presentation Quality** | 15% | Clear communication, time management |
| **Q&A Response** | 10% | Thoughtful answers, technical depth |

## What Makes an "A" Presentation?

**Architecture Understanding:**
- Correctly applies course concepts
- Shows clear separation of concerns
- Demonstrates understanding of trade-offs

**Decision Quality:**
- ADRs have clear context and rationale
- Alternatives were genuinely considered
- Trade-offs are acknowledged

**Implementation:**
- Demo works smoothly
- Code follows discussed patterns
- Evidence of testing/quality

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Too much code walkthrough** - Show architecture, not every file

❌ **No trade-offs discussed** - Every decision has downsides

❌ **Demo-heavy, architecture-light** - Features matter less than design

❌ **Rushed Q&A** - Save time for questions

❌ **No backup for demo** - Technology fails; be prepared

❌ **Vague ADRs** - "We chose React because it's popular" isn't sufficient

# Effective Presentations {.section-slide background-color="#d6001c"}

## Know Your Audience

You're presenting to:

- **Instructors** who know the concepts (don't over-explain basics)
- **Classmates** who don't know your specific project
- **Technical audience** who appreciates depth

Balance:
- Enough context for understanding
- Enough depth to show mastery
- Not so much detail that you lose people

## Visual Communication

**Good slides:**

- Diagrams over bullet points
- Code snippets (short, focused)
- Screenshots of key UI
- Architecture visualizations

**Avoid:**

- Walls of text
- Tiny font sizes
- Full source files
- Reading slides verbatim

## Handling Q&A

**Prepare for common questions:**

- "Why didn't you use X instead?"
- "How does Y scale?"
- "What would you do differently?"
- "How do you handle Z edge case?"

**Good responses:**

- Acknowledge the question
- Give a direct answer
- Explain reasoning
- Admit uncertainty if appropriate ("We haven't tested that yet, but...")

# Presentation Order {.section-slide background-color="#d6001c"}

## Team 1

*Presentation begins*

---

**Remember:**
- 10-15 minutes presentation
- 5 minutes Q&A
- Feedback is constructive

## Q&A Template

Questions to consider asking:

1. **Architecture:** "How did you decide where to put [X] in your layers?"

2. **Trade-offs:** "What downside of [decision] have you experienced?"

3. **Alternatives:** "Did you consider [Y]? What made you choose [X]?"

4. **Scale:** "How would this handle [larger load]?"

5. **Lessons:** "If starting over, what would you change?"

# Wrap-Up {.section-slide background-color="#d6001c"}

## Common Themes

*To be filled in after presentations*

- Successful patterns observed
- Common challenges
- Interesting solutions
- Areas for improvement

## Friday: Project Work Day

Use Friday's session to:

- Incorporate feedback from today
- Refactor based on insights
- Address technical debt
- Prepare for second half of semester

## Looking Ahead: Weeks 8-14

The second half of the course covers:

- **Authentication & Security** (Week 8)

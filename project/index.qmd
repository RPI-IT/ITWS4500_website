title: "Semester Project"
subtitle: "Building a Real-World Application for Impact"
---

## Project Overview

The semester project is your opportunity to apply the architectural patterns, development practices, and deployment strategies learned throughout the course to build a **real-world application**. You will work in teams of 3-4 members to conceptualize, design, build, and deploy a functional web application.

::: {.callout-important}
## Project Focus
Your project should address a genuine problem or opportunity through one of these lenses:

- **Startup Idea**: A product concept you could potentially launch
- **External Stakeholder**: An application for a real organization, club, or community
- **Social Impact**: A solution addressing a meaningful social or environmental challenge

| [Project Proposal](proposal.qmd) | 15% |
| [Midterm Update](midterm.qmd) | 20% |
| [Final Presentation](final.qmd) | 25% |
| **Total Project Weight** | **60%** |

## Team Requirements

### Team Composition
- **Size**: 3-4 members per team
- **Roles**: Each member should take ownership of specific areas (frontend, backend, data, DevOps)
- **Collaboration**: All members must contribute code and participate in architectural decisions

### Team Formation Process
1. Form teams during Week 1 (by January 16)
2. Register your team on the LMS
3. Create your team's GitHub organization or repository
4. Set up your project management tool

## Project Management Requirements

::: {.callout-warning}
## Required: Integrated Project Management
Your project **must** use a structured project management approach with visible progress tracking.
:::

### Option 1: GitHub Projects (Recommended)

Use GitHub's built-in project management features:

- **GitHub Projects**: Kanban boards integrated with your repository
- **Issues**: Track features, bugs, and tasks
- **Milestones**: Group issues into sprints or phases
- **Pull Requests**: Link PRs to issues for traceability

**Setup Requirements:**
```
Repository Structure:
├── .github/
│   ├── ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
│   │   ├── feature.md
│   │   ├── bug.md
│   │   └── task.md
│   └── PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
├── docs/
│   └── architecture/
├── src/
└── README.md
```

### Option 2: External Tools (Jira, Linear, Notion)

If you prefer external tools, they must be:

- **Publicly viewable** or instructor access granted
- **Linked** from your repository README
- **Actively maintained** with regular updates
- **Integrated** with GitHub (e.g., Jira-GitHub integration)

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture Requirements

Your application must demonstrate understanding of course concepts:

1. **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns (presentation, business logic, data)
2. **API Design**: RESTful or GraphQL API with proper documentation
3. **Data Persistence**: Appropriate database choice with justified trade-offs
4. **Authentication**: Secure user authentication and authorization
5. **Containerization**: Docker-based development and deployment

### Technology Stack

**Required:**
- Frontend: React, Vue, Angular, or equivalent modern framework
- Backend: Node.js/Express, Python/FastAPI, or equivalent
- Database: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or justified alternative
- Containerization: Docker and Docker Compose
- Version Control: Git with GitHub

**Encouraged:**
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions or equivalent
- Cloud Deployment: Any cloud provider
- Agentic AI: Integration of AI-powered features

## Grading Philosophy

Projects are evaluated on:

1. **Architectural Decisions** (30%): Sound design choices with clear rationale
2. **Implementation Quality** (25%): Clean, maintainable, well-tested code
3. **Project Management** (20%): Effective use of tools, clear progress tracking
4. **Presentation & Communication** (15%): Clear explanation of decisions and trade-offs
5. **Innovation & Ambition** (10%): Scope appropriate to team size, creative solutions

::: {.callout-note}
## A Note on Scope
A well-executed simple project will score higher than a poorly-executed ambitious one. Focus on demonstrating mastery of patterns and practices over feature quantity.

title: "Project Proposal"
subtitle: "Defining Your Vision and Architecture"
---

::: {.callout-important}
## Proposal Information
**Due Date:** Friday, January 30, 2026
**Presentation:** In-class presentations during Week 3
**Weight:** 15% of total project grade (9% of course grade)
:::

## Overview

The project proposal is your team's opportunity to define a compelling problem, articulate your solution, and outline the architectural approach you'll take. This is not just a document—it's a presentation to your peers and instructors that demonstrates your understanding of the problem space and your plan to address it.

## The Startup/Stakeholder Lens

Your proposal should frame the project as if you were:

- **Pitching to investors**: What problem are you solving? Why does it matter?
- **Consulting for a client**: Who is the stakeholder? What are their needs?
- **Launching a product**: Who are your users? What's your value proposition?

::: {.callout-tip}
## Pro Tip
Even if your project is for a class, treating it as a real product forces you to think about users, value, and sustainability—skills that transfer directly to industry.

- Current alternatives and their limitations

#### Proposed Solution (1 page)
- High-level description of your application
- Core features (MVP scope)
- User stories for primary use cases
- Differentiation from existing solutions

#### Technical Architecture (1-2 pages)
- System architecture diagram
- Technology stack with justification
- Data model overview
- API design approach
- Authentication and security considerations
- Deployment strategy

#### Project Management Plan (0.5 page)
- Team roles and responsibilities

### 2. GitHub Repository Setup

Your repository must be initialized with:

```
project-name/
├── README.md                 # Project overview, setup instructions
├── docs/
│   ├── proposal.md          # Your proposal document
│   └── architecture/
│       └── decisions/       # Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
├── .github/
│   ├── ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
│   └── PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
├── docker-compose.yml       # Initial compose file (can be placeholder)
└── .gitignore
```

### 3. Project Board Initialization

Set up your project management with:

- At least 3 milestones defined (Proposal, Midterm, Final)
- Initial backlog of 10+ issues/tasks
- Labels for categorization (feature, bug, documentation, etc.)
- Team member assignments

### 4. In-Class Presentation (5-7 minutes)

Present your proposal to the class covering:

1. **The Hook** (1 min): What problem are you solving and why does it matter?
2. **The Solution** (2 min): What are you building and for whom?
3. **The Architecture** (2 min): How will you build it? Key technical decisions?
4. **The Plan** (1-2 min): How will you manage the project and track progress?

## Examples of Strong Proposals

### Startup Idea Example
> **TaskFlow AI**: An AI-powered task management platform that automatically prioritizes work based on deadlines, dependencies, and team capacity. Unlike existing tools, TaskFlow uses natural language processing to convert meeting notes and emails into actionable tasks.

### External Stakeholder Example
> **RPI Club Connect**: A platform for the RPI Student Union to manage club registration, event scheduling, and member communication. Built in partnership with the Student Senate to address pain points in the current manual process.

### Social Impact Example
> **FoodShare Network**: A peer-to-peer platform connecting restaurants with surplus food to local shelters and food banks. Reduces food waste while addressing food insecurity in the Capital Region.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

::: {.callout-warning}
## Watch Out For

- **Scope Creep**: Proposing too many features for the timeline
- **Technology Tourism**: Choosing tech because it's "cool" rather than appropriate
- **Vague Users**: Not clearly defining who will use the application
- **Missing MVP**: No clear definition of minimum viable product
- **No Evidence**: Claiming a problem exists without any validation

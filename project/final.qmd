## Final Presentation Information
**Due Date:** Tuesday, April 28, 2026
**Presentation:** Final class session
**Weight:** 25% of total project grade (15% of course grade)
:::

## Overview

The final presentation is your opportunity to showcase the culmination of a semester's work. You'll present a complete, deployed application while reflecting on your architectural decisions, team dynamics, and learning journey. This is both a technical demonstration and a professional presentation of your work.

## Final Project Expectations

By the final presentation, your project should demonstrate:

- **Deployed and accessible**: Application running on cloud infrastructure
- **Feature complete**: All planned MVP features implemented
- **Production ready**: Error handling, security considerations, documentation
- **Well documented**: README, API docs, architecture decision records
- **Professionally managed**: Complete project history visible in GitHub

::: {.callout-note}
## The "Ship It" Standard
Your application should be something you'd be proud to show to a potential employer, investor, or stakeholder. It doesn't need to be perfect, but it should be complete, functional, and professionally presented.
:::

## Deliverables

### 1. Deployed Application

Your application must be:

- **Publicly accessible** via a URL (cloud deployment required)
- **Functional** with all core features working
- **Stable** enough for a live demonstration
- **Secure** with proper authentication and data protection

**Deployment Options:**
- Railway, Render, Fly.io (recommended for ease)
- AWS, GCP, Azure (more complex but valuable experience)
- DigitalOcean, Linode (good middle ground)

### 2. Final Technical Report (5-7 pages)

#### Executive Summary (0.5 page)
- What you built and why
- Key accomplishments
- Live application URL

- Final system architecture diagram
- Technology stack with retrospective on choices
- Complete ADR summary (what decisions were made and why)
- Security measures implemented
- Scalability considerations

#### Feature Documentation (1-1.5 pages)
- Complete feature list with descriptions
- User flows with screenshots
- API documentation summary (link to full docs)
- Known limitations and future enhancements

#### Development Journey (1-1.5 pages)
- Evolution from proposal to final
- Major pivots and their rationale
- Technical challenges and solutions
- What you would do differently

#### Project Management Retrospective (1 page)
- Final project metrics (issues, PRs, commits by member)
- Sprint velocity analysis
- Team dynamics and collaboration assessment
- Process improvements discovered

#### Individual Contributions (0.5 page per member)
- Each team member writes a brief summary of their contributions
- Key learnings and growth areas

### 3. Complete GitHub Repository

Your repository should be a portfolio piece:

### 4. Peer Evaluations

Each team member submits a confidential peer evaluation:

- Rate each team member's contribution (1-5 scale)
- Provide specific examples of contributions
- Identify team strengths and areas for improvement
- Self-assessment of your own contribution

::: {.callout-warning}
## Peer Evaluation Impact
Significant discrepancies in peer evaluations may result in individual grade adjustments. Be honest and fair in your assessments.
:::

### 5. Final Presentation (12-15 minutes)

Present your completed project to the class:

1. **The Pitch** (2 min): Problem, solution, and value proposition recap
2. **Live Demo** (5-6 min): Complete walkthrough of key features
3. **Architecture Tour** (3 min): Technical decisions, trade-offs, and learnings
4. **Team Retrospective** (2-3 min): What worked, what didn't, what you learned
5. **Q&A** (2 min): Field questions from class and instructors

## Grading Philosophy for Final

The final grade weighs both **product** and **process**:

**Product (60%):**
- Does the application work?
- Is it deployed and accessible?
- Does it solve the stated problem?

**Process (40%):**
- Was the project well-managed?
- Did the team collaborate effectively?
- Are decisions documented?
- Is the codebase maintainable?

::: {.callout-tip}
## What Makes an "A" Project?
An "A" project demonstrates mastery of course concepts through thoughtful architectural decisions, clean implementation, effective teamwork, and honest reflection on the development journey. It's not about feature count—it's about doing things well.
:::

## Post-Course Opportunities

Exceptional projects may be considered for:

- **Showcase presentation** to department or industry partners
- **Continued development** as independent study
- **Publication** in student portfolios or case studies

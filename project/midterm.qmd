## Midterm Information
**Due Date:** Tuesday, February 24, 2026
**Presentation:** In-class presentations during Week 7
**Weight:** 20% of total project grade (12% of course grade)
:::

## Overview

The midterm update is a checkpoint to assess your team's progress, validate your architectural decisions, and ensure you're on track for a successful final delivery. This is your opportunity to demonstrate a working MVP, reflect on what you've learned, and adjust your plan based on real-world development experience.

## What You Should Have Completed

By midterm, your project should demonstrate:

- **Core functionality working**: At least 2-3 key features implemented end-to-end
- **Full-stack integration**: Frontend, backend, and database connected and working
- **Containerized development**: Docker Compose environment functional
- **Active project management**: Evidence of sprint planning, issue tracking, and code review

::: {.callout-note}
## The "Walking Skeleton" Standard
Your application should be a "walking skeleton"—a thin slice of functionality that touches all architectural layers. It doesn't need to be feature-complete, but it must prove your architecture works.
:::

## Deliverables

### 1. Working Application Demo

Prepare a **live demonstration** of your application showing:

- User authentication flow (if applicable)
- Core feature walkthrough (2-3 primary use cases)
- Data persistence verification
- Containerized deployment

**Demo Requirements:**
- Must run from Docker Compose (`docker compose up`)
- Should be reproducible from a fresh clone
- Include seed data or easy setup for demo purposes

### 2. Technical Progress Report (3-4 pages)

#### Architecture Evolution (1 page)
- Original architecture vs. current implementation
- Decisions changed and why (include ADRs)
- Technical challenges encountered and solutions
- Diagrams showing current system state

#### Implementation Status (1 page)
- Features completed with evidence (screenshots, code references)
- Features in progress with current state
- Features deferred with reasoning
- Test coverage and quality metrics

#### Project Management Review (1 page)
- Sprint retrospectives summary
- Velocity/burndown data (if using Scrum)
- Project board screenshot with current state
- Team contribution analysis (GitHub Insights)

#### Path to Final (0.5-1 page)
- Remaining work itemized
- Updated timeline
- Identified risks and mitigation
- Resource or scope adjustments needed

### 3. GitHub Repository State

Your repository should demonstrate:

```

└── .github/
    └── workflows/               # CI pipeline (encouraged)
```

### 4. Project Management Artifacts

Evidence of active project management:

- **Closed Issues**: At least 15 issues closed since proposal
- **Pull Requests**: Evidence of code review process
- **Milestones**: Progress visible toward defined milestones
- **Sprint History**: If using Scrum, evidence of completed sprints

### 5. In-Class Presentation (8-10 minutes)

Present your progress to the class:

1. **Recap** (1 min): Brief reminder of your project and goals
2. **Live Demo** (3-4 min): Show your working application
3. **Architecture Deep-Dive** (2 min): Key technical decisions and learnings
4. **Project Health** (1-2 min): Progress metrics, team dynamics, project management
5. **Path Forward** (1 min): What's next, any pivots or adjustments

## Midterm Checkpoint Expectations

### Minimum Viable Progress

To receive a passing grade on the midterm, you must demonstrate:

- [ ] Docker Compose environment runs with one command
- [ ] At least one complete user flow working (e.g., signup → create item → view item)
- [ ] Database connected and persisting data
- [ ] Frontend and backend communicating via API
- [ ] Evidence of 10+ completed issues in project tracker
- [ ] Evidence of code review (merged PRs with comments)

### Signs of Excellent Progress

Teams exceeding expectations typically show:

- [ ] Multiple complete features with edge case handling
- [ ] Automated tests with reasonable coverage
- [ ] CI pipeline running on push
- [ ] Clear ADRs documenting major decisions
- [ ] Thoughtful UI/UX design
- [ ] Evidence of user feedback incorporation

## Common Midterm Challenges

::: {.callout-warning}
## Watch Out For

- **Demo Disasters**: Always have a backup plan (recorded demo, screenshots)
- **Environment Issues**: Test your `docker compose up` on a fresh machine before presenting
- **Scope Denial**: Be honest about what's working vs. "almost working"
- **Ghost Team Members**: Address contribution imbalances now, not at final
- **Technical Debt**: Document it; don't pretend it doesn't exist
:::

## Recovering from a Rough Start

If your team is behind, the midterm is the time to course-correct:

1. **Be honest** in your report about challenges
2. **Reduce scope** to focus on core functionality
3. **Create a recovery plan** with realistic milestones
4. **Seek help** during office hours or TA sessions

Teams that honestly assess their situation and create realistic plans are viewed more favorably than teams that overpromise and underdeliver.

## Submission Instructions

1. **Technical Report**: Submit PDF to LMS by 11:59 PM on February 24
2. **Repository Link**: Ensure all code is pushed and README is updated
3. **Demo Preparation**: Have your demo ready to run at the start of class
4. **Presentation**: Be prepared to present during class on February 24

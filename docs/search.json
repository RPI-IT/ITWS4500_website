Students will examine architectural and design patterns that underlie contemporary web platforms, emphasizing system decomposition, data flow, scalability, reliability, and security.\nThe course adopts a full-stack perspective, integrating modern frontend frameworks, backend services, databases, and APIs into cohesive and maintainable applications. Core technologies include HTML5/CSS3, JavaScript-based frontend frameworks, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and related tooling. Students will also explore user experience design, data modeling, and performance considerations that influence real-world application behavior.\nIn addition, the course introduces intelligent and automated system components, including AI-assisted development workflows and agent-based automation, and examines how such capabilities can be safely and effectively incorporated into web applications. Emphasis is placed on testing, containerization, continuous integration and deployment, and cloud-based deployment and scaling using contemporary platforms and practices.\nThe course is lab-intensive and project-driven, with students working collaboratively to design, build, deploy, and present a full-stack web application."

Full-Stack Technology Integration\nStudents will demonstrate the ability to design and implement full-stack web applications using a modern frontend, backend services, databases, and APIs, integrating multiple technologies into a coherent and maintainable system.\n\n\n3. Design, UX, and Data Considerations\nStudents will demonstrate understanding of the technical, data, and user-experience considerations that influence the design of production-quality web applications, including state management, performance, usability, and data modeling.\n\n\n4. Intelligent and Automated Systems\nStudents will demonstrate the ability to incorporate intelligent components into web applications, including AI-assisted development workflows and agent-based automation, while reasoning about correctness, reliability, and human oversight.\n\n\n5. Deployment, Scaling, and Operations\nStudents will demonstrate the ability to deploy, test, and operate web applications in cloud environments, applying containerization, CI/CD pipelines, and scaling patterns to support real-world usage.\n\n\n6. Technical Communication and Analysis\nStudents will be able to investigate, analyze, and clearly communicate architectural and technical decisions, including trade-offs and alternatives, in a manner that enables others to understand and evaluate complex systems.\n\n\n7. Collaborative Development and Professional Practice\nStudents will demonstrate effective collaboration and professional software development practices, including version control, testing, documentation, and team-based project execution."

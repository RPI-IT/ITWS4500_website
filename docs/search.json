    "text": "Introduction\nData is at the heart of every application. How you model, store, and access data has profound implications for performance, scalability, and maintainability. This week, we dive deep into data architecture—the practice of designing data systems that meet your application’s specific needs.\nWe’ll explore different database paradigms, understand when to use each, and learn patterns for managing data consistency in distributed systems. This reading builds on the polyglot persistence concepts introduced last week and provides the foundation for Lab 5, where you’ll implement a multi-database architecture."

    "text": "Database Paradigms\n\nDocument Databases (MongoDB)\nDocument databases store data as flexible, JSON-like documents. Each document can have a different structure, making them ideal for evolving schemas and hierarchical data.\nCharacteristics: - Schema flexibility within collections - Nested documents and arrays - Horizontal scaling through sharding - Rich query language - Eventual consistency by default (tunable)\nBest For: - Content management systems - User profiles with varying attributes - Product catalogs with different product types - Real-time analytics - Rapid prototyping\nMongoDB Document Example:\n{\n  _id: ObjectId(\"64f...\"),\n  type: \"electronics\",\n  name: \"Wireless Headphones\",\n  price: 149.99,\n  specs: {\n    bluetooth: \"5.0\",\n    batteryLife: \"30 hours\",\n    noiseCancellation: true,\n    drivers: \"40mm\"\n  },\n  reviews: [\n    {\n      userId: ObjectId(\"64a...\"),\n      rating: 5,\n      comment: \"Great sound quality!\",\n      createdAt: ISODate(\"2026-01-15\")\n    }\n  ],\n  inventory: {\n    warehouse: \"NYC\",\n    quantity: 150,\n    lastRestocked: ISODate(\"2026-01-10\")\n  },\n  tags: [\"audio\", \"wireless\", \"premium\"],\n  createdAt: ISODate(\"2025-06-01\"),\n  updatedAt: ISODate(\"2026-01-15\")\n}\n\n\nRelational Databases (PostgreSQL)\nRelational databases organize data into tables with predefined schemas. They excel at maintaining data integrity through constraints, relationships, and ACID transactions.\nCharacteristics: - Strict schema enforcement - ACID transactions - Complex joins and queries - Referential integrity - Mature tooling and expertise\nBest For: - Financial transactions - Inventory management - User authentication and authorization - Reporting and analytics - Any data requiring strict consistency\nPostgreSQL Schema Example:\n-- Users table\nCREATE TABLE users (\n  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,\n  password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\n  role VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'user',\n  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\n  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n\n-- Orders table with foreign key\nCREATE TABLE orders (\n  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n  user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),\n  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending',\n  total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,\n  shipping_address JSONB,\n  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\n  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n\n-- Order items (junction table)\nCREATE TABLE order_items (\n  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n  order_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES orders(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n  product_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,  -- References MongoDB product\n  quantity INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (quantity &gt; 0),\n  unit_price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,\n  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n\n-- Indexes for common queries\nCREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_id ON orders(user_id);\nCREATE INDEX idx_orders_status ON orders(status);\nCREATE INDEX idx_order_items_order_id ON order_items(order_id);\n\n\nKey-Value Stores (Redis)\nKey-value stores provide extremely fast read/write operations by mapping keys directly to values. They’re ideal for caching and real-time data.\nCharacteristics: - Sub-millisecond latency - Simple data model - In-memory storage (with persistence options) - Rich data structures (strings, lists, sets, hashes, sorted sets) - Pub/sub messaging\nBest For: - Session storage - Caching - Real-time leaderboards - Rate limiting - Message queues - Real-time analytics\nRedis Data Structures:\n# Strings - Simple key-value\nSET user:123:name \"John Doe\"\nGET user:123:name\n\n# Hashes - Object-like storage\nHSET user:123 name \"John\" email \"john@example.com\" role \"admin\"\nHGETALL user:123\n\n# Lists - Ordered collections\nLPUSH notifications:user:123 \"New message from Alice\"\nLRANGE notifications:user:123 0 9  # Get latest 10\n\n# Sets - Unique collections\nSADD user:123:followers \"user:456\" \"user:789\"\nSISMEMBER user:123:followers \"user:456\"\n\n# Sorted Sets - Ranked collections\nZADD leaderboard 1500 \"user:123\" 2000 \"user:456\" 1800 \"user:789\"\nZREVRANGE leaderboard 0 9 WITHSCORES  # Top 10\n\n# Expiration\nSETEX session:abc123 3600 '{\"userId\": \"123\"}'  # Expires in 1 hour\n\n\nSearch Engines (Elasticsearch)\nSearch engines are optimized for full-text search, log analysis, and complex aggregations over large datasets.\nCharacteristics: - Full-text search with relevance scoring - Near real-time indexing - Distributed and scalable - Rich aggregation framework - Schema-on-read flexibility\nBest For: - Product search - Log aggregation and analysis - Metrics and monitoring - Geospatial queries - Autocomplete and suggestions\nElasticsearch Example:\n// Index a document\nawait client.index({\n  index: 'products',\n  id: 'prod-123',\n  body: {\n    name: 'Wireless Bluetooth Headphones',\n    description: 'Premium noise-cancelling headphones with 30-hour battery',\n    category: 'electronics',\n    price: 149.99,\n    tags: ['audio', 'wireless', 'bluetooth'],\n    specs: {\n      brand: 'AudioPro',\n      color: 'black',\n      weight: '250g'\n    },\n    createdAt: '2026-01-15T10:00:00Z'\n  }\n});\n\n// Full-text search with filters\nconst results = await client.search({\n  index: 'products',\n  body: {\n    query: {\n      bool: {\n        must: [\n          {\n            multi_match: {\n              query: 'wireless headphones',\n              fields: ['name^3', 'description', 'tags'],\n              fuzziness: 'AUTO'\n            }\n          }\n        ],\n        filter: [\n          { range: { price: { lte: 200 } } },\n          { term: { category: 'electronics' } }\n        ]\n      }\n    },\n    highlight: {\n      fields: { name: {}, description: {} }\n    },\n    aggs: {\n      price_ranges: {\n        range: {\n          field: 'price',\n          ranges: [\n            { to: 50 },\n            { from: 50, to: 100 },\n            { from: 100, to: 200 },\n            { from: 200 }\n          ]\n        }\n      },\n      by_brand: {\n        terms: { field: 'specs.brand.keyword' }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n});"

    "text": "Data Modeling Patterns\n\nDenormalization for Performance\nIn document databases, denormalization trades storage space for query performance:\n// Normalized (requires join/lookup)\n// users collection\n{ _id: \"user1\", name: \"Alice\" }\n\n// posts collection\n{ _id: \"post1\", authorId: \"user1\", title: \"Hello World\" }\n\n// Denormalized (self-contained)\n// posts collection\n{\n  _id: \"post1\",\n  title: \"Hello World\",\n  author: {\n    _id: \"user1\",\n    name: \"Alice\",\n    avatarUrl: \"/avatars/alice.jpg\"\n  }\n}\nTrade-offs: - Faster reads - No joins needed - Slower writes - Must update multiple documents when author changes - Data staleness - Denormalized data may become outdated - Storage increase - Duplicate data uses more space\n\n\nHandling Many-to-Many Relationships\nIn MongoDB (Array of References):\n// For small to medium collections\n// tags collection\n{ _id: \"tag1\", name: \"javascript\" }\n{ _id: \"tag2\", name: \"react\" }\n\n// posts collection\n{\n  _id: \"post1\",\n  title: \"React Hooks Guide\",\n  tagIds: [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"]  // Array of references\n}\n\n// Query posts by tag\ndb.posts.find({ tagIds: \"tag1\" });\n\n// Populate tags (application-level join)\nconst post = await Post.findById(postId).populate('tagIds');\nIn PostgreSQL (Junction Table):\n-- Junction table for many-to-many\nCREATE TABLE post_tags (\n  post_id INTEGER REFERENCES posts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n  tag_id INTEGER REFERENCES tags(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n  PRIMARY KEY (post_id, tag_id)\n);\n\n-- Query posts with a specific tag\nSELECT p.*\nFROM posts p\nJOIN post_tags pt ON p.id = pt.post_id\nJOIN tags t ON pt.tag_id = t.id\nWHERE t.name = 'javascript';\n\n\nPolymorphic Patterns\nWhen different entity types share some fields but differ in others:\nSingle Collection with Type Field:\n// MongoDB: notifications collection\n{\n  _id: \"notif1\",\n  type: \"comment\",\n  userId: \"user1\",\n  createdAt: ISODate(\"2026-01-15\"),\n  // Type-specific fields\n  postId: \"post1\",\n  commentId: \"comment1\",\n  commenterName: \"Bob\"\n}\n\n{\n  _id: \"notif2\",\n  type: \"follow\",\n  userId: \"user1\",\n  createdAt: ISODate(\"2026-01-15\"),\n  // Type-specific fields\n  followerId: \"user2\",\n  followerName: \"Alice\"\n}\n\n{\n  _id: \"notif3\",\n  type: \"mention\",\n  userId: \"user1\",\n  createdAt: ISODate(\"2026-01-15\"),\n  // Type-specific fields\n  postId: \"post2\",\n  mentionedBy: \"user3\"\n}\nMongoose Discriminators:\nconst notificationSchema = new mongoose.Schema({\n  userId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },\n  read: { type: Boolean, default: false },\n  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now }\n}, { discriminatorKey: 'type' });\n\nconst Notification = mongoose.model('Notification', notificationSchema);\n\n// Comment notification discriminator\nconst CommentNotification = Notification.discriminator('comment',\n  new mongoose.Schema({\n    postId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Post' },\n    commentId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Comment' },\n    commenterName: String\n  })\n);\n\n// Follow notification discriminator\nconst FollowNotification = Notification.discriminator('follow',\n  new mongoose.Schema({\n    followerId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' },\n    followerName: String\n  })\n);\n\n// Query all notifications (both types)\nconst notifications = await Notification.find({ userId: user._id });\n\n// Query only follow notifications\nconst follows = await FollowNotification.find({ userId: user._id });\n\n\nTime-Series Data\nFor data that’s primarily written once and queried by time ranges:\n// MongoDB: Bucket pattern for time-series\n{\n  _id: ObjectId(\"...\"),\n  sensorId: \"sensor-001\",\n  bucket: \"2026-01-15T10:00\",  // Hourly bucket\n  measurements: [\n    { timestamp: ISODate(\"2026-01-15T10:00:15\"), temp: 22.5, humidity: 45 },\n    { timestamp: ISODate(\"2026-01-15T10:01:30\"), temp: 22.6, humidity: 44 },\n    { timestamp: ISODate(\"2026-01-15T10:02:45\"), temp: 22.4, humidity: 46 }\n    // ... up to N measurements per bucket\n  ],\n  count: 180,  // Number of measurements in bucket\n  sum: { temp: 4050, humidity: 8100 },  // For calculating averages\n  min: { temp: 22.1, humidity: 42 },\n  max: { temp: 23.0, humidity: 48 }\n}\n\n// Query: Get hourly averages for a day\ndb.sensorData.aggregate([\n  {\n    $match: {\n      sensorId: \"sensor-001\",\n      bucket: {\n        $gte: \"2026-01-15T00:00\",\n        $lt: \"2026-01-16T00:00\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    $project: {\n      bucket: 1,\n      avgTemp: { $divide: [\"$sum.temp\", \"$count\"] },\n      avgHumidity: { $divide: [\"$sum.humidity\", \"$count\"] }\n    }\n  }\n]);"

    "text": "Data Consistency Patterns\n\nCAP Theorem\nThe CAP theorem states that a distributed system can provide at most two of three guarantees:\n\nConsistency: All nodes see the same data at the same time\nAvailability: Every request receives a response\nPartition Tolerance: System continues to operate despite network partitions\n\n                    Consistency\n                        /\\\n                       /  \\\n                      /    \\\n                     /      \\\n                    /   CA   \\\n                   /          \\\n                  /____________\\\n                 /\\            /\\\n                /  \\    CP    /  \\\n               / AP \\        /    \\\n              /______\\______/______\\\n         Availability        Partition\n                            Tolerance\nIn Practice: - Network partitions are inevitable - You must choose between CP (consistency) and AP (availability) - MongoDB and PostgreSQL are typically CP (strong consistency) - Cassandra and DynamoDB are typically AP (high availability)\n\n\nEventual Consistency\nIn eventually consistent systems, updates propagate asynchronously:\nTime T0: User updates profile name to \"Alice\"\n         └─── Write to Primary\n\nTime T1: Primary acknowledges write\n         └─── User sees \"Alice\"\n         └─── Replica 1 still shows \"Bob\"\n\nTime T2: Replication in progress\n         └─── Replica 1 receives update\n\nTime T3: All replicas consistent\n         └─── All reads return \"Alice\"\nHandling Eventual Consistency:\n// Read your own writes pattern\nasync function updateProfile(userId, updates) {\n  const user = await User.findByIdAndUpdate(userId, updates, { new: true });\n\n  // Cache the update for this user's session\n  await redis.setex(`user:${userId}:profile`, 60, JSON.stringify(user));\n\n  return user;\n}\n\nasync function getProfile(userId, requestingUserId) {\n  // If user is reading their own profile, check cache first\n  if (userId === requestingUserId) {\n    const cached = await redis.get(`user:${userId}:profile`);\n    if (cached) return JSON.parse(cached);\n  }\n\n  // Otherwise, read from database\n  return await User.findById(userId);\n}\n\n\nTransaction Patterns\nSingle Database Transactions (ACID):\n// PostgreSQL transaction with Prisma\nconst result = await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) =&gt; {\n  // Deduct from sender\n  const sender = await tx.account.update({\n    where: { id: senderId },\n    data: { balance: { decrement: amount } }\n  });\n\n  if (sender.balance &lt; 0) {\n    throw new Error('Insufficient funds');\n  }\n\n  // Add to receiver\n  const receiver = await tx.account.update({\n    where: { id: receiverId },\n    data: { balance: { increment: amount } }\n  });\n\n  // Record transfer\n  const transfer = await tx.transfer.create({\n    data: {\n      senderId,\n      receiverId,\n      amount,\n      status: 'completed'\n    }\n  });\n\n  return transfer;\n});\nSaga Pattern for Distributed Transactions:\nWhen operations span multiple services/databases, use the Saga pattern:\n// Orchestration-based Saga\nclass OrderSaga {\n  async execute(orderData) {\n    const steps = [];\n\n    try {\n      // Step 1: Create order (pending)\n      const order = await this.orderService.create(orderData);\n      steps.push({ service: 'order', action: 'create', data: order });\n\n      // Step 2: Reserve inventory\n      const reservation = await this.inventoryService.reserve(order.items);\n      steps.push({ service: 'inventory', action: 'reserve', data: reservation });\n\n      // Step 3: Process payment\n      const payment = await this.paymentService.charge(order.total, order.userId);\n      steps.push({ service: 'payment', action: 'charge', data: payment });\n\n      // Step 4: Confirm order\n      await this.orderService.confirm(order.id);\n\n      return order;\n    } catch (error) {\n      // Compensate in reverse order\n      await this.compensate(steps);\n      throw error;\n    }\n  }\n\n  async compensate(steps) {\n    for (const step of steps.reverse()) {\n      try {\n        switch (step.service) {\n          case 'order':\n            await this.orderService.cancel(step.data.id);\n            break;\n          case 'inventory':\n            await this.inventoryService.release(step.data.reservationId);\n            break;\n          case 'payment':\n            await this.paymentService.refund(step.data.transactionId);\n            break;\n        }\n      } catch (compensationError) {\n        // Log and alert - manual intervention may be needed\n        console.error('Compensation failed:', compensationError);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nOutbox Pattern\nFor reliable event publishing with database changes:\n// Instead of:\n// 1. Update database\n// 2. Publish event (might fail, leaving inconsistent state)\n\n// Use outbox pattern:\n// 1. Update database AND write to outbox table (single transaction)\n// 2. Separate process reads outbox and publishes events\n\n// Step 1: Write operation with outbox\nasync function completeOrder(orderId) {\n  await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) =&gt; {\n    // Update order status\n    await tx.order.update({\n      where: { id: orderId },\n      data: { status: 'completed', completedAt: new Date() }\n    });\n\n    // Write to outbox (same transaction)\n    await tx.outbox.create({\n      data: {\n        aggregateType: 'Order',\n        aggregateId: orderId,\n        eventType: 'OrderCompleted',\n        payload: JSON.stringify({ orderId, completedAt: new Date() }),\n        createdAt: new Date()\n      }\n    });\n  });\n}\n\n// Step 2: Outbox processor (runs periodically)\nasync function processOutbox() {\n  const events = await prisma.outbox.findMany({\n    where: { processedAt: null },\n    orderBy: { createdAt: 'asc' },\n    take: 100\n  });\n\n  for (const event of events) {\n    try {\n      // Publish to message broker\n      await messageBroker.publish(event.eventType, JSON.parse(event.payload));\n\n      // Mark as processed\n      await prisma.outbox.update({\n        where: { id: event.id },\n        data: { processedAt: new Date() }\n      });\n    } catch (error) {\n      console.error('Failed to process outbox event:', event.id, error);\n      // Will retry on next run\n    }\n  }\n}"

Many of you have been generating code with AI tools — which is great for productivity — but to debug, modify, and make architectural decisions, you need to understand what that code is doing.\nThe Lab 4 solution demonstrates four implementations of the same application using different combinations of React, Next.js, Express, and MongoDB. This week’s tutorials will help you understand the core concepts behind those implementations."

    "text": "RESTful API Design\n\nWhat is REST?\nREST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs use HTTP as the communication protocol and organize operations around resources—the nouns of your domain.\nKey REST principles:\n\nClient-Server Separation - Client and server evolve independently\nStatelessness - Each request contains all information needed to process it\nUniform Interface - Consistent conventions for interacting with resources\nLayered System - Clients can’t tell if they’re connected directly to the server\nCacheability - Responses indicate whether they can be cached\n\n\n\nResource-Oriented Design\nResources are the core concept in REST. Every URL represents a resource:\n/api/users              → Collection of users\n/api/users/123          → Specific user\n/api/users/123/tasks    → Tasks belonging to user 123\n/api/tasks/456          → Specific task\nGuidelines for Resource URLs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuideline\nGood\nAvoid\n\n\n\n\nUse nouns, not verbs\n/api/tasks\n/api/getTasks\n\n\nUse plural nouns\n/api/users\n/api/user\n\n\nUse lowercase\n/api/tasks\n/api/Tasks\n\n\nUse hyphens for readability\n/api/task-categories\n/api/taskCategories\n\n\nNest for relationships\n/api/projects/123/tasks\n/api/projectTasks?projectId=123\n\n\n\n\n\nHTTP Methods and CRUD Operations\nHTTP methods map to CRUD operations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nOperation\nEndpoint\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nGET\nRead\n/api/tasks\nList all tasks\n\n\nGET\nRead\n/api/tasks/123\nGet task 123\n\n\nPOST\nCreate\n/api/tasks\nCreate new task\n\n\nPUT\nReplace\n/api/tasks/123\nReplace task 123 entirely\n\n\nPATCH\nUpdate\n/api/tasks/123\nUpdate specific fields of task 123\n\n\nDELETE\nDelete\n/api/tasks/123\nDelete task 123\n\n\n\nMethod Properties:\n\n\n\nMethod\nIdempotent\nSafe\nRequest Body\n\n\n\n\nGET\nYes\nYes\nNo\n\n\nPOST\nNo\nNo\nYes\n\n\nPUT\nYes\nNo\nYes\n\n\nPATCH\nNo\nNo\nYes\n\n\nDELETE\nYes\nNo\nOptional\n\n\n\n\nIdempotent: Multiple identical requests produce the same result\nSafe: Request doesn’t modify server state\n\n\n\nHTTP Status Codes\nStatus codes communicate the result of a request:\n2xx - Success\n200 OK              - Request succeeded\n201 Created         - Resource created (include Location header)\n204 No Content      - Success with no response body (DELETE)\n3xx - Redirection\n301 Moved Permanently - Resource has new URL\n304 Not Modified      - Cached version is still valid\n4xx - Client Errors\n400 Bad Request     - Invalid request syntax/data\n401 Unauthorized    - Authentication required\n403 Forbidden       - Authenticated but not authorized\n404 Not Found       - Resource doesn't exist\n409 Conflict        - Request conflicts with current state\n422 Unprocessable   - Valid syntax but semantic errors\n5xx - Server Errors\n500 Internal Error  - Generic server error\n502 Bad Gateway     - Upstream server error\n503 Service Unavailable - Server temporarily unavailable\n\n\nRequest and Response Design\nConsistent Response Structure:\n// Success response\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"id\": \"123\",\n    \"title\": \"Complete API design\",\n    \"status\": \"pending\"\n  },\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"timestamp\": \"2026-01-20T10:00:00Z\"\n  }\n}\n\n// Collection response with pagination\n{\n  \"data\": [\n    { \"id\": \"1\", \"title\": \"Task 1\" },\n    { \"id\": \"2\", \"title\": \"Task 2\" }\n  ],\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"total\": 150,\n    \"page\": 1,\n    \"perPage\": 20,\n    \"totalPages\": 8\n  },\n  \"links\": {\n    \"self\": \"/api/tasks?page=1\",\n    \"next\": \"/api/tasks?page=2\",\n    \"last\": \"/api/tasks?page=8\"\n  }\n}\n\n// Error response\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": \"VALIDATION_ERROR\",\n    \"message\": \"Request validation failed\",\n    \"details\": [\n      { \"field\": \"title\", \"message\": \"Title is required\" },\n      { \"field\": \"priority\", \"message\": \"Priority must be low, medium, or high\" }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nQuery Parameters\nUse query parameters for filtering, sorting, and pagination:\n# Filtering\nGET /api/tasks?status=pending\nGET /api/tasks?status=pending&priority=high\nGET /api/tasks?assignee=user123\n\n# Sorting\nGET /api/tasks?sort=createdAt        # Ascending\nGET /api/tasks?sort=-createdAt       # Descending\nGET /api/tasks?sort=-priority,createdAt  # Multiple fields\n\n# Pagination\nGET /api/tasks?page=2&limit=20\nGET /api/tasks?offset=20&limit=20\n\n# Field selection (sparse fieldsets)\nGET /api/tasks?fields=id,title,status\n\n# Search\nGET /api/tasks?q=meeting\nGET /api/tasks?search=urgent+deadline\n\n# Date ranges\nGET /api/tasks?createdAfter=2026-01-01&createdBefore=2026-01-31\n\n\nImplementing REST in Express\nconst express = require('express');\nconst router = express.Router();\n\n// GET /api/tasks - List tasks\nrouter.get('/', async (req, res, next) =&gt;

Documents are BSON objects (like JSON):\n// Task document\n{\n  _id: ObjectId(\"64a...\"),\n  title: \"Complete API design\",\n  description: \"Design RESTful endpoints for task management\",\n  status: \"in_progress\",\n  priority: \"high\",\n  dueDate: ISODate(\"2026-02-01\"),\n  createdAt: ISODate(\"2026-01-15\"),\n  updatedAt: ISODate(\"2026-01-20\"),\n  createdBy: ObjectId(\"64b...\"),  // Reference to user\n  assignee: {                      // Embedded document\n    _id: ObjectId(\"64c...\"),\n    name: \"John Doe\",\n    email: \"john@example.com\"\n  },\n  tags: [\"api\", \"design\"],         // Array\n  comments: [                      // Array of embedded documents\n    {\n      _id: ObjectId(\"64d...\"),\n      text: \"Looking good!\",\n      author: ObjectId(\"64e...\"),\n      createdAt: ISODate(\"2026-01-18\")\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nEmbedding vs. Referencing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApproach\nWhen to Use\nExample\n\n\n\n\nEmbedding\nData accessed together, one-to-few relationships\nComments in a task\n\n\nReferencing\nData accessed independently, one-to-many/many-to-many\nUsers and tasks\n\n\n\nEmbedding Example:\n// Embedded comments - always fetched with task\nconst taskSchema = new mongoose.Schema({\n  title: String,\n  comments: [{\n    text: String,\n    authorId: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,\n    authorName: String,  // Denormalized for display\n    createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now }\n  }]\n});\n\n// Adding a comment\nawait Task.findByIdAndUpdate(taskId, {\n  $push: {\n    comments: {\n      text: \"New comment\",\n      authorId: user._id,\n      authorName: user.name\n    }\n  }\n});\nReferencing Example:\n// Referenced assignee - fetched separately when needed\nconst taskSchema = new mongoose.Schema({\n  title: String,\n  assigneeId: {\n    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,\n    ref: 'User'\n  }\n});\n\n// Populate when needed\nconst task = await Task.findById(taskId)\n  .populate('assigneeId', 'name email');\n\n\n\nMongoose Schema Design\n// models/Task.js\nconst mongoose = require('mongoose');\n\nconst taskSchema = new mongoose.Schema({\n  title: {\n    type: String,\n    required: [true, 'Title is required'],\n    trim: true,\n    maxlength: [200, 'Title cannot exceed 200 characters']\n  },\n  description: {\n    type: String,\n    trim: true,\n    maxlength: [2000, 'Description cannot exceed 2000 characters']\n  },\n  status: {\n    type: String,\n    enum: ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'],\n    default: 'pending'\n  },\n  priority: {\n    type: String,\n    enum: ['low', 'medium', 'high'],\n    default: 'medium'\n  },\n  dueDate: Date,\n  completedAt: Date,\n  createdBy: {\n    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,\n    ref: 'User',\n    required: true\n  },\n  assigneeId: {\n    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,\n    ref: 'User'\n  },\n  projectId: {\n    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,\n    ref: 'Project'\n  },\n  tags: [String],\n  metadata: {\n    type: Map,\n    of: String\n  }\n}, {\n  timestamps: true,  // Adds createdAt and updatedAt\n  toJSON: { virtuals: true },\n  toObject: { virtuals: true }\n});\n\n// Indexes for common queries\ntaskSchema.index({ status: 1, dueDate: 1 });\ntaskSchema.index({ assigneeId: 1, status: 1 });\ntaskSchema.index({ projectId: 1, createdAt: -1 });\ntaskSchema.index({ createdBy: 1 });\ntaskSchema.index({ tags: 1 });\n\n// Text index for search\ntaskSchema.index({ title: 'text', description: 'text' });\n\n// Virtual property\ntaskSchema.virtual('isOverdue').get(function() {\n  if (!this.dueDate || this.status === 'completed') return false;\n  return new Date() &gt; this.dueDate;\n});\n\n// Instance method\ntaskSchema.methods.complete = function() {\n  if (this.status === 'completed') {\n    throw new Error('Task is already completed');\n  }\n  this.status = 'completed';\n  this.completedAt = new Date();\n  return this.save();\n};\n\n// Static method\ntaskSchema.statics.findByAssignee = function(userId, options = {}) {\n  const query = this.find({ assigneeId: userId });\n\n  if (options.status) {\n    query.where('status').equals(options.status);\n  }\n\n  return query.sort({ dueDate: 1 });\n};\n\n// Pre-save hook\ntaskSchema.pre('save', function(next) {\n  if (this.isModified('status') && this.status === 'completed') {\n    this.completedAt = new Date();\n  }\n  next();\n});\n\nconst Task = mongoose.model('Task', taskSchema);\nmodule.exports = Task;\n\n\nQuery Optimization\n\nUsing Indexes\nIndexes dramatically improve query performance:\n// Without index: Collection scan (slow)\ndb.tasks.find({ assigneeId: ObjectId(\"...\") })\n\n// With index: Index scan (fast)\ntaskSchema.index({ assigneeId: 1 });\nIndex Types:\n// Single field index\ntaskSchema.index({ status: 1 });\n\n// Compound index (order matters!)\ntaskSchema.index({ projectId: 1, createdAt: -1 });\n\n// Text index for full-text search\ntaskSchema.index({ title: 'text', description: 'text' });\n\n// Unique index\nuserSchema.index({ email: 1 }, { unique: true });\n\n// Sparse index (only index documents with the field)\ntaskSchema.index({ assigneeId: 1 }, { sparse: true });\n\n// TTL index (auto-delete documents)\nsessionSchema.index({ createdAt: 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds: 3600 });\n\n\nQuery Patterns\n// Efficient: Uses index\nconst tasks = await Task\n  .find({ projectId, status: 'pending' })\n  .sort({ dueDate: 1 })\n  .limit(20)\n  .select('title status dueDate');  // Only fetch needed fields\n\n// Inefficient: Can't use index effectively\nconst tasks = await Task\n  .find({ $or: [{ status: 'pending' }, { priority: 'high' }] })\n  .sort({ randomField: 1 });\n\n// Pagination with cursor (better for large datasets)\nconst tasks = await Task\n  .find({ _id: { $gt: lastSeenId } })\n  .sort({ _id: 1 })\n  .limit(20);\n\n// Aggregation pipeline for complex queries\nconst tasksByStatus = await Task.aggregate([\n  { $match: { projectId: mongoose.Types.ObjectId(projectId) } },\n  { $group: {\n      _id: '$status',\n      count: { $sum: 1 },\n      avgPriority: { $avg: { $cond: [\n        { $eq: ['$priority', 'high'] }, 3,\n        { $cond: [{ $eq: ['$priority', 'medium'] }, 2, 1] }\n      ]}}\n    }\n  },\n  { $sort: { count: -1 } }\n]);\n\n\n\nTransactions\nFor operations that must succeed or fail together:\nconst session = await mongoose.startSession();\nsession.startTransaction();\n\ntry {\n  // Create task\n  const task = await Task.create([{\n    title: 'New Task',\n    projectId: project._id,\n    createdBy: user._id\n  }], { session });\n\n  // Update project task count\n  await Project.findByIdAndUpdate(\n    project._id,\n    { $inc: { taskCount: 1 } },\n    { session }\n  );\n\n  await session.commitTransaction();\n  return task[0];\n} catch (error) {\n  await session.abortTransaction();\n  throw error;\n} finally {\n  session.endSession();\n}"

What was once a relatively straightforward process of writing code and deploying it to a server has become a complex orchestration of services, containers, cloud platforms, and automated pipelines. This course takes a pattern-first approach to understanding these systems, focusing on the architectural decisions that shape how we build, deploy, and maintain software.\nThis first reading establishes two foundational concepts: understanding modern application architecture as a collection of patterns, and mastering Infrastructure as Code (IaC) as the foundation for reproducible, scalable systems."

    "text": "The Evolution of Application Architecture\n\nFrom Monoliths to Distributed Systems\nEarly web applications followed a simple pattern: a single application running on a single server, connecting to a single database. This monolithic architecture served well for many years and still has its place today. However, as applications grew in complexity and scale, limitations emerged:\n\nScaling challenges: The entire application must scale together, even if only one component needs more resources\nDeployment risk: A small change requires redeploying the entire application\nTechnology lock-in: The entire application must use the same technology stack\nTeam coordination: Large teams working on a single codebase create coordination overhead\n\nModern applications increasingly adopt distributed architectures where functionality is split across multiple services. This includes microservices, where each service handles a specific business capability, and the client-server model we’ll use in this course, where distinct frontend and backend applications communicate over APIs.\n\n\nThe MERN Stack as Reference Architecture\nThroughout this course, we use the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) as our reference implementation. This isn’t because MERN is the only or best stack—it’s because it provides clear examples of architectural patterns that apply across technologies:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nRole\nPattern Demonstrated\n\n\n\n\nMongoDB\nDocument database\nPersistence layer, NoSQL patterns\n\n\nExpress\nBackend framework\nAPI design, middleware, routing\n\n\nReact\nFrontend library\nComponent architecture, state management\n\n\nNode.js\nRuntime environment\nEvent-driven architecture, JavaScript everywhere\n\n\n\nThe patterns you learn with MERN—separation of concerns, API design, component architecture, state management—transfer directly to other stacks like Django/React, Spring Boot/Angular, or Rails/Vue."

    "text": "Infrastructure as Code\n\nThe “Works on My Machine” Problem\nConsider this common scenario: A developer builds a feature that works perfectly on their laptop. They commit the code, and it passes tests in the CI pipeline. But when deployed to production, it fails. The culprit? A difference in environment—perhaps a different Node.js version, a missing environment variable, or a different database configuration.\nThis environment drift has plagued software development for decades. Traditional solutions involved detailed setup documentation, configuration management tools, and significant DevOps effort. Containers offer a more elegant solution.\n\n\nWhat is Infrastructure as Code?\nInfrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files rather than manual processes. Instead of clicking through a cloud console or SSH-ing into servers to install software, you write code that describes your infrastructure.\nKey principles of IaC include:\n\nDeclarative definitions: You describe what you want, not how to achieve it\nVersion control: Infrastructure definitions are stored in Git alongside application code\nReproducibility: The same definition produces identical environments every time\nAutomation: Infrastructure changes are applied through automated processes\n\n\n\nContainers: The Building Blocks\nA container is a lightweight, standalone package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software: code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Containers solve the environment problem by packaging the environment with the application.\n\nContainers vs. Virtual Machines\nContainers are often compared to virtual machines (VMs), but they operate at a different level:\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                    Virtual Machines                          │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐         │\n│  │    App A    │  │    App B    │  │    App C    │         │\n│  ├─────────────┤  ├─────────────┤  ├─────────────┤         │\n│  │   Bins/Libs │  │   Bins/Libs │  │   Bins/Libs │         │\n│  ├─────────────┤  ├─────────────┤  ├─────────────┤         │\n│  │  Guest OS   │  │  Guest OS   │  │  Guest OS   │         │\n│  └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘         │\n│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐       │\n│  │                   Hypervisor                     │       │\n│  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘       │\n│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐       │\n│  │                    Host OS                       │       │\n│  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘       │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                       Containers                             │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐         │\n│  │    App A    │  │    App B    │  │    App C    │         │\n│  ├─────────────┤  ├─────────────┤  ├─────────────┤         │\n│  │   Bins/Libs │  │   Bins/Libs │  │   Bins/Libs │         │\n│  └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘         │\n│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐       │\n│  │              Container Runtime (Docker)          │       │\n│  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘       │\n│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐       │\n│  │                    Host OS                       │       │\n│  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘       │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\nKey differences:\n\n\n\nAspect\nVirtual Machines\nContainers\n\n\n\n\nSize\nGigabytes\nMegabytes\n\n\nStartup time\nMinutes\nSeconds\n\n\nResource usage\nHeavy (full OS)\nLight (shared kernel)\n\n\nIsolation\nComplete (hardware-level)\nProcess-level\n\n\nPortability\nLimited\nHigh\n\n\n\nContainers share the host operating system’s kernel, making them dramatically lighter and faster than VMs while still providing isolation between applications."

    "section": "Docker Fundamentals",
    "text": "Docker Fundamentals\nDocker is the most widely used container platform. Understanding Docker requires grasping three core concepts: images, containers, and registries.\n\nImages\nA Docker image is a read-only template containing instructions for creating a container. Think of it as a snapshot of a configured system. Images are built in layers, where each layer represents a set of filesystem changes.\n# Each instruction creates a new layer\nFROM node:20-alpine          # Base layer: Node.js on Alpine Linux\nWORKDIR /app                 # Create working directory\nCOPY package*.json ./        # Copy dependency files\nRUN npm install              # Install dependencies (new layer)\nCOPY . .                     # Copy application code (new layer)\nCMD [\"npm\", \"start\"]         # Default command (metadata, not a layer)\nThe layered architecture provides several benefits:\n\nCaching: Unchanged layers are cached and reused, speeding up builds\nSharing: Multiple images can share common base layers\nEfficiency: Only changed layers need to be transferred or rebuilt\n\n\n\nContainers\nA container is a running instance of an image. You can run multiple containers from the same image, each with its own isolated filesystem, network, and process space.\n# Run a container from an image\ndocker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name my-app my-image\n\n# Key flags:\n# -d          Run in background (detached)\n# -p 3000:3000  Map port 3000 on host to port 3000 in container\n# --name      Give the container a name\nContainers are ephemeral by design—they can be stopped, started, and destroyed without affecting the underlying image. Any data written inside a container is lost when the container is removed unless you use volumes.\n\n\nRegistries\nA registry is a repository for Docker images. Docker Hub is the default public registry, but organizations often run private registries. Images are identified by their registry, name, and tag:\nregistry.example.com/my-org/my-app:v1.2.3\n└──────┬──────────┘ └──┬───┘ └─┬──┘ └─┬──┘\n    registry      organization  name   tag"

    "section": "Writing Effective Dockerfiles",
    "text": "Writing Effective Dockerfiles\nA Dockerfile is a text file containing instructions to build an image. Writing effective Dockerfiles is a skill that improves with practice.\n\nBasic Structure\n# Specify base image\nFROM node:20-alpine\n\n# Set working directory\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# Copy dependency files first (for better caching)\nCOPY package*.json ./\n\n# Install dependencies\nRUN npm ci --only=production\n\n# Copy application code\nCOPY . .\n\n# Expose port (documentation)\nEXPOSE 3000\n\n# Set the default command\nCMD [\"node\", \"server.js\"]\n\n\nBest Practices\n1. Use specific base image tags\n# Bad: Uses latest, which changes over time\nFROM node:latest\n\n# Good: Pins to specific version\nFROM node:20.10-alpine\n2. Minimize layers and combine commands\n# Bad: Creates multiple layers\nRUN apt-get update\nRUN apt-get install -y curl\nRUN apt-get clean\n\n# Good: Single layer, includes cleanup\nRUN apt-get update && \\\n    apt-get install -y curl && \\\n    apt-get clean && \\\n    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n3. Order instructions from least to most frequently changed\n# Dependencies change less often than code\nCOPY package*.json ./\nRUN npm install\n# Code changes frequently - this layer rebuilds often\nCOPY . .\n4. Use .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files\nThe .dockerignore file tells Docker which files and directories to exclude when building an image. When you run docker build, Docker does not automatically send your entire project directory into the image. Instead, it first creates a build context—a snapshot of your project folder—and .dockerignore controls what does not get included in that snapshot.\n# .dockerignore\nnode_modules\n.git\n.env\n*.log\nREADME.md\n\n\nMulti-Stage Builds\nMulti-stage builds allow you to use multiple FROM statements, copying only what you need from each stage. This produces smaller, more secure production images.\n# Stage 1: Build\nFROM node:20-alpine AS builder\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY package*.json ./\nRUN npm ci\nCOPY . .\nRUN npm run build\n\n# Stage 2: Production\nFROM node:20-alpine\nWORKDIR /app\n# Copy only production dependencies\nCOPY package*.json ./\nRUN npm ci --only=production\n# Copy only built artifacts from builder\nCOPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist\nUSER node\nCMD [\"node\", \"dist/server.js\"]\nThe final image contains only the production runtime—no build tools, source code, or development dependencies."

    "text": "Docker Compose: Multi-Service Orchestration\nReal applications consist of multiple services: a frontend, backend API, database, cache, and more. Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications.\n\nThe docker-compose.yml File\nDocker Compose uses YAML files to define services, networks, and volumes:\nservices:\n  frontend:\n    build:\n      context: ./frontend\n      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev\n    ports:\n      - \"3000:3000\"\n    volumes:\n      - ./frontend:/app\n      - /app/node_modules\n    environment:\n      - VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000\n    depends_on:\n      - api\n\n  api:\n    build:\n      context: ./api\n      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev\n    ports:\n      - \"4000:4000\"\n    volumes:\n      - ./api:/app\n      - /app/node_modules\n    environment:\n      - NODE_ENV=development\n      - MONGODB_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/myapp\n    depends_on:\n      mongo:\n        condition: service_healthy\n\n  mongo:\n    image: mongo:7\n    ports:\n      - \"27017:27017\"\n    volumes:\n      - mongo-data:/data/db\n    healthcheck:\n      test: [\"CMD\", \"mongosh\", \"--eval\", \"db.adminCommand('ping')\"]\n      interval: 10s\n      timeout: 5s\n      retries: 5\n\nvolumes:\n  mongo-data:\n\n\nKey Concepts\nServices define the containers that make up your application. Each service can be built from a Dockerfile or use a pre-built image.\nNetworks enable communication between containers. Docker Compose creates a default network where services can reach each other by name (e.g., api can connect to mongo using the hostname mongo).\nVolumes persist data beyond the container lifecycle. Named volumes (like mongo-data) are managed by Docker, while bind mounts (like ./api:/app) map host directories into containers.\nDependencies define startup order. The depends_on key ensures services start in the right order, and condition: service_healthy waits for health checks to pass.\n\n\nDevelopment Workflow with Docker Compose\nFor development, we configure containers to support hot reloading—automatic restarts when code changes:\nvolumes:\n  - ./api:/app          # Mount source code\n  - /app/node_modules   # Preserve container's node_modules\nThe bind mount makes host files available in the container, so changes are immediately visible. The anonymous volume for node_modules prevents the host’s node_modules (if any) from overwriting the container’s dependencies.\n\n\nCommon Commands\n# Build and start all services\ndocker compose up --build\n\n# Start in background\ndocker compose up -d\n\n# View logs\ndocker compose logs -f api\n\n# Stop all services\ndocker compose down\n\n# Stop and remove volumes (resets data)\ndocker compose down -v\n\n# Rebuild a specific service\ndocker compose build api\n\n# Execute command in running container\ndocker compose exec api npm test"

Context causes re-renders of all consumers on any state change. With our cart updating frequently, this caused performance issues.\nWhy not Redux? Too much boilerplate for our team size and timeline. Redux Toolkit helped, but Zustand was simpler.\nTrade-off: Less ecosystem (middleware, devtools) than Redux, but acceptable for our scope."

The midterm represents an opportunity to synthesize these concepts by documenting and presenting the architectural decisions you’ve made in your projects.\nThis reading serves two purposes: first, to introduce Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) and trade-off analysis as professional practices; second, to review the key concepts from Weeks 1-6 that form the foundation of your architectural understanding."

    "section": "Architectural Decision Records",
    "text": "Architectural Decision Records\n\nWhy Document Decisions?\nEvery software project involves countless decisions: Which framework to use? How to structure the codebase? What database fits our needs? Where to draw service boundaries? These decisions, once made, shape the project’s trajectory and constrain future options.\nYet decisions are often lost to institutional memory. New team members join and wonder “why did we do it this way?” Original authors leave, taking context with them. Months later, even the same developer may not remember the reasoning behind a choice.\nArchitectural Decision Records (ADRs) solve this problem by documenting decisions in a structured, lightweight format. They capture not just what was decided, but why—including the context, alternatives considered, and trade-offs evaluated.\n\n\nThe ADR Format\nA standard ADR contains these sections:\n# ADR-001: Use MongoDB for Primary Data Store\n\n## Status\nAccepted\n\n## Context\nOur application needs to store user profiles, posts, and comments.\nThe data model is still evolving as we discover user needs. We expect\nto scale to thousands of concurrent users within the first year.\n\n## Decision\nWe will use MongoDB as our primary data store for user-generated content.\n\n## Consequences\n### Positive\n- Flexible schema accommodates evolving data models\n- Document model maps naturally to our JavaScript objects\n- Horizontal scaling through sharding when needed\n- Strong Node.js ecosystem support with Mongoose\n\n### Negative\n- No built-in support for complex joins (must denormalize or use aggregation)\n- Eventual consistency by default (must configure for strong consistency if needed)\n- Team must learn MongoDB query patterns and indexing strategies\n\n### Risks\n- Large documents could impact performance; will monitor document sizes\n- Schema flexibility could lead to inconsistent data if not validated\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n\n### PostgreSQL\n- Pros: ACID compliance, powerful query language, mature ecosystem\n- Cons: Rigid schema less suited to evolving requirements, more complex\n  setup for Node.js applications\n- Why rejected: Our data model is still unstable; schema migrations\n  would slow development\n\n### Firebase Firestore\n- Pros: Managed service, real-time sync, serverless-friendly\n- Cons: Vendor lock-in, limited query capabilities, costs scale with reads\n- Why rejected: Prefer portable solution, more query flexibility needed\n\n\nADR Best Practices\n1. Write ADRs at decision time\nDocument decisions when you make them, not after. The context and reasoning are freshest in your mind, and the act of writing often clarifies thinking.\n2. Keep ADRs short and focused\nEach ADR should address one decision. A good ADR fits on one to two pages. If it’s longer, you’re probably covering multiple decisions.\n3. Number ADRs sequentially\nUse a simple numbering scheme (ADR-001, ADR-002) to track decisions over time. This creates a chronological record of architectural evolution.\n4. ADRs are immutable\nOnce accepted, don’t modify an ADR. If a decision changes, create a new ADR that supersedes the old one. This preserves the historical record.\n5. Store ADRs with code\nKeep ADRs in your repository (typically in docs/adr/ or docs/decisions/). This ensures they’re version-controlled and discoverable.\n\n\nADR Templates by Decision Type\nDifferent decisions benefit from different emphases:\nTechnology Selection ADR\n# ADR-XXX: Select [Technology] for [Purpose]\n\n## Status\n[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-YYY]\n\n## Context\n- What problem are we solving?\n- What are our requirements and constraints?\n- What is the team's current expertise?\n\n## Decision\nWe will use [technology] because [primary reasons].\n\n## Consequences\n- What becomes easier?\n- What becomes harder?\n- What new skills does the team need?\n- What are the cost implications?\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n- [Alternative 1]: Why not chosen\n- [Alternative 2]: Why not chosen\nArchitectural Pattern ADR\n# ADR-XXX: Adopt [Pattern] for [Aspect]\n\n## Status\n[Status]\n\n## Context\n- What architectural challenge are we addressing?\n- What quality attributes matter most (scalability, maintainability, etc.)?\n\n## Decision\nWe will structure [aspect] using the [pattern] pattern.\n\n## Consequences\n- How does this affect system complexity?\n- What coupling/cohesion trade-offs are we making?\n- How does this impact testing and deployment?\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n- [Alternative pattern]: Trade-offs comparison"

    "text": "Trade-off Analysis\n\nThe Reality of Engineering Trade-offs\nEvery architectural decision involves trade-offs. There is no “best” solution—only solutions that optimize for different qualities. Understanding and articulating these trade-offs is a core engineering skill.\n\n\nThe Quality Attributes\nSoftware architecture balances multiple quality attributes (also called “-ilities”):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttribute\nDescription\nTension With\n\n\n\n\nPerformance\nResponse time, throughput, resource efficiency\nSecurity, Maintainability\n\n\nScalability\nAbility to handle growth\nSimplicity, Cost\n\n\nAvailability\nSystem uptime, fault tolerance\nConsistency, Cost\n\n\nSecurity\nProtection against threats\nUsability, Performance\n\n\nMaintainability\nEase of modification\nPerformance, Time-to-market\n\n\nTestability\nEase of verification\nTime-to-market\n\n\nUsability\nUser experience quality\nSecurity, Complexity\n\n\nSimplicity\nSystem understandability\nFeature completeness\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade-off Analysis Framework\nWhen evaluating architectural options, use this structured approach:\nStep 1: Identify Quality Priorities\nNot all quality attributes matter equally for every project. A real-time trading system prioritizes performance; a medical records system prioritizes security; a startup MVP prioritizes time-to-market.\nFor our project, the priority order is:\n1. Maintainability (team is learning, code will change)\n2. Simplicity (limited development time)\n3. Performance (adequate for expected load)\n4. Scalability (not a concern for MVP)\nStep 2: Enumerate Options\nList the viable approaches without judging them:\nOptions for state management:\nA. Local component state only (useState)\nB. React Context for shared state\nC. Zustand for global state\nD. Redux Toolkit for complex state\nStep 3: Evaluate Each Option Against Priorities\nCreate a decision matrix:\n\n\n\nOption\nMaintainability\nSimplicity\nPerformance\nLearning Curve\n\n\n\n\nuseState only\nMedium\nHigh\nHigh\nLow\n\n\nReact Context\nMedium\nMedium\nMedium*\nLow\n\n\nZustand\nHigh\nHigh\nHigh\nLow\n\n\nRedux Toolkit\nHigh\nLow\nHigh\nHigh\n\n\n\n*Context can cause unnecessary re-renders if not carefully structured.\nStep 4: Make and Document the Decision\nChoose the option that best balances your priorities, then document the reasoning in an ADR.\n\n\nCommon Trade-off Patterns\nFlexibility vs. Simplicity\nMore flexible systems handle more cases but are harder to understand:\n// Simple but inflexible\nfunction formatDate(date) {\n  return date.toLocaleDateString('en-US');\n}\n\n// Flexible but complex\nfunction formatDate(date, options = {}) {\n  const {\n    locale = 'en-US',\n    format = 'long',\n    includeTime = false,\n    timezone = undefined\n  } = options;\n\n  const dateOptions = {\n    dateStyle: format,\n    ...(includeTime && { timeStyle: 'short' }),\n    ...(timezone && { timeZone: timezone })\n  };\n\n  return date.toLocaleString(locale, dateOptions);\n}\nConsistency vs. Availability (CAP Theorem)\nIn distributed systems, you must choose between strong consistency and high availability during network partitions:\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                    CAP Theorem                          │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│                                                         │\n│            Consistency                                  │\n│               /\\                                        │\n│              /  \\                                       │\n│             /    \\                                      │\n│            / CA   \\   CP                               │\n│           /        \\                                    │\n│          /──────────\\                                   │\n│         Availability  Partition                        │\n│                       Tolerance                         │\n│                                                         │\n│  CA: Traditional RDBMS (single node)                   │\n│  CP: MongoDB (with write concern majority)             │\n│  AP: DynamoDB, Cassandra (eventual consistency)        │\n│                                                         │\n│  In practice, network partitions happen, so you        │\n│  choose between CP and AP for distributed systems.     │\n│                                                         │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\nNormalization vs. Performance\nNormalized databases minimize redundancy but require joins:\n// Normalized: Separate collections, references\n// Pros: No data duplication, easy updates\n// Cons: Requires multiple queries or $lookup\n\nconst post = {\n  _id: ObjectId('...'),\n  title: 'Understanding Trade-offs',\n  authorId: ObjectId('...'),  // Reference to users collection\n  categoryIds: [ObjectId('...'), ObjectId('...')]\n};\n\n// Denormalized: Embedded data\n// Pros: Single query retrieves everything\n// Cons: Data duplication, complex updates\n\nconst post = {\n  _id: ObjectId('...'),\n  title: 'Understanding Trade-offs',\n  author: {\n    _id: ObjectId('...'),\n    name: 'Jane Developer',\n    avatar: 'jane.jpg'\n  },\n  categories: [\n    { _id: ObjectId('...'), name: 'Architecture' },\n    { _id: ObjectId('...'), name: 'Best Practices' }\n  ]\n};"

    "text": "Presentation Best Practices\n\nStructuring Your Midterm Presentation\nYour midterm presentation should demonstrate understanding of architectural concepts through your project implementation. Structure it as follows:\n1. Project Overview (2 minutes) - What does your application do? - Who are the users? - What are the core features?\n2. Architectural Decisions (5-7 minutes) - Present 2-3 key ADRs - For each: Context, Decision, Trade-offs - Connect decisions to course concepts\n3. Technical Demonstration (3-5 minutes) - Show the architecture in action - Demonstrate a key feature flow - Highlight how layers interact\n4. Lessons Learned (2-3 minutes) - What would you do differently? - What patterns proved most valuable? - What challenges remain?\n\n\nEffective Technical Presentations\nKnow Your Audience Assume your audience understands the course concepts but doesn’t know your specific project. Explain your choices in terms of the patterns we’ve studied.\nShow, Don’t Just Tell Use diagrams, code snippets, and live demos. A 30-second demo often communicates more than 5 minutes of description.\nAnticipate Questions Think about alternative approaches you considered. Why didn’t you choose them? What trade-offs did you make?\nPractice Timing Presentations always take longer than expected. Practice your full presentation at least twice, and have cuts ready if you run long.\n\n\nVisual Aids\nArchitecture Diagrams Show how components connect:\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                    Your Application                      │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│                                                         │\n│   ┌─────────────┐         ┌─────────────────────┐      │\n│   │   React     │         │      Express        │      │\n│   │   Frontend  │  REST   │      Backend        │      │\n│   │             │ ──────▶ │                     │      │\n│   │ Components  │         │ Routes → Controllers│      │\n│   │ State (Ctx) │ ◀────── │       → Services   │      │\n│   │ React Router│  JSON   │       → Models     │      │\n│   └─────────────┘         └──────────┬──────────┘      │\n│                                      │                  │\n│                           ┌──────────▼──────────┐      │\n│                           │      MongoDB        │      │\n│                           │    (via Mongoose)   │      │\n│                           └─────────────────────┘      │\n│                                                         │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\nData Flow Diagrams Trace a request through your system:\nUser Action: \"Create Post\"\n        │\n        ▼\n┌───────────────────┐\n│ PostForm Component│  1.

This week, we go deeper into two critical areas: React component architecture and state management on the frontend, and backend service patterns that support scalable API development.\nComponent architecture is about more than just organizing files—it’s about designing systems of reusable, composable pieces that work together effectively. Similarly, backend patterns help you structure your API code to handle growing complexity while remaining maintainable."

Single Responsibility\nEach component should do one thing well:\n// Bad: Component doing too much\nfunction TaskManager() {\n  // Fetching data\n  // Managing form state\n  // Handling validation\n  // Rendering list\n  // Rendering form\n  // Handling filters\n  // All in one component...\n}\n\n// Good: Separated responsibilities\nfunction TasksPage() {\n  return (\n    &lt;div className=\"tasks-page\"&gt;\n      &lt;TaskFilters /&gt;\n      &lt;TaskList /&gt;\n      &lt;TaskForm /&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n}\n\n\n2. Composition Over Configuration\nPrefer composing simple components over configuring complex ones:\n// Bad: One component with many configuration props\n&lt;Card\n  title=\"Task\"\n  showHeader={true}\n  showFooter={true}\n  headerActions={['edit', 'delete']}\n  footerContent={&lt;Button&gt;Save&lt;/Button&gt;}\n  bordered={true}\n  shadowed={true}\n  // ... many more props\n/&gt;\n\n// Good: Composed from simple components\n&lt;Card bordered shadowed&gt;\n  &lt;Card.Header&gt;\n    &lt;Card.Title&gt;Task&lt;/Card.Title&gt;\n    &lt;Card.Actions&gt;\n      &lt;EditButton /&gt;\n      &lt;DeleteButton /&gt;\n    &lt;/Card.Actions&gt;\n  &lt;/Card.Header&gt;\n  &lt;Card.Body&gt;\n    {/* content */}\n  &lt;/Card.Body&gt;\n  &lt;Card.Footer&gt;\n    &lt;Button&gt;Save&lt;/Button&gt;\n  &lt;/Card.Footer&gt;\n&lt;/Card&gt;\n\n\n3. Props Down, Events Up\nData flows down through props; changes propagate up through callbacks:\nfunction TaskList({ tasks, onTaskComplete, onTaskDelete }) {\n  return (\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      {tasks.map(task =&gt; (\n        &lt;TaskItem\n          key={task.id}\n          task={task}\n          onComplete={() =&gt; onTaskComplete(task.id)}\n          onDelete={() =&gt; onTaskDelete(task.id)}\n        /&gt;\n      ))}\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n  );\n}\n\nfunction TaskItem({ task, onComplete, onDelete }) {\n  return (\n    &lt;li&gt;\n      &lt;span&gt;{task.title}&lt;/span&gt;\n      &lt;button onClick={onComplete}&gt;Complete&lt;/button&gt;\n      &lt;button onClick={onDelete}&gt;Delete&lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nComponent Categories\n\nPresentational Components\nFocus purely on rendering UI:\n// Button.jsx - Presentational component\nfunction Button({\n  children,\n  variant = 'primary',\n  size = 'medium',\n  disabled = false,\n  onClick\n}) {\n  return (\n    &lt;button\n      className={`btn btn-${variant} btn-${size}`}\n      disabled={disabled}\n      onClick={onClick}\n    &gt;\n      {children}\n    &lt;/button&gt;\n  );\n}\n\n// TaskCard.jsx - Presentational component\nfunction TaskCard({ task, onEdit, onDelete, onToggleComplete }) {\n  const statusClass = task.completed ? 'completed' :\n                      task.priority === 'high' ?

Understanding where state should live is crucial for maintainable applications.\n\nState Placement Guidelines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState Type\nWhere to Put It\nExample\n\n\n\n\nUI State\nLocal component\nModal open/closed, form input values\n\n\nShared UI State\nNearest common ancestor\nSelected tab in sibling components\n\n\nServer Cache\nCustom hook or library\nFetched data, loading states\n\n\nGlobal App State\nContext or state library\nCurrent user, theme, permissions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal State with useState\nFor state that doesn’t need to be shared:\nfunction TaskForm({ onSubmit }) {\n  // Form state is local to this component\n  const [title, setTitle] = useState('');\n  const [description, setDescription] = useState('');\n  const [priority, setPriority] = useState('medium');\n  const [errors, setErrors] = useState({});\n\n  const validate = () =&gt; {\n    const newErrors = {};\n    if (!title.trim()) {\n      newErrors.title = 'Title is required';\n    }\n    if (!['low', 'medium', 'high'].includes(priority)) {\n      newErrors.priority = 'Invalid priority';\n    }\n    setErrors(newErrors);\n    return Object.keys(newErrors).length === 0;\n  };\n\n  const handleSubmit = (e) =&gt; {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    if (validate()) {\n      onSubmit({ title, description, priority });\n      // Reset form\n      setTitle('');\n      setDescription('');\n      setPriority('medium');\n    }\n  };\n\n  return (\n    &lt;form onSubmit={handleSubmit}&gt;\n      &lt;div className=\"form-group\"&gt;\n        &lt;label htmlFor=\"title\"&gt;Title&lt;/label&gt;\n        &lt;input\n          id=\"title\"\n          value={title}\n          onChange={(e) =&gt; setTitle(e.target.value)}\n          className={errors.title ? 'error' : ''}\n        /&gt;\n        {errors.title && &lt;span className=\"error-message\"&gt;{errors.title}&lt;/span&gt;}\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n\n      &lt;div className=\"form-group\"&gt;\n        &lt;label htmlFor=\"description\"&gt;Description&lt;/label&gt;\n        &lt;textarea\n          id=\"description\"\n          value={description}\n          onChange={(e) =&gt; setDescription(e.target.value)}\n        /&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n\n      &lt;div className=\"form-group\"&gt;\n        &lt;label htmlFor=\"priority\"&gt;Priority&lt;/label&gt;\n        &lt;select\n          id=\"priority\"\n          value={priority}\n          onChange={(e) =&gt; setPriority(e.target.value)}\n        &gt;\n          &lt;option value=\"low\"&gt;Low&lt;/option&gt;\n          &lt;option value=\"medium\"&gt;Medium&lt;/option&gt;\n          &lt;option value=\"high\"&gt;High&lt;/option&gt;\n        &lt;/select&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n\n      &lt;button type=\"submit\"&gt;Create Task&lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;/form&gt;\n  );\n}\n\n\nComplex Local State with useReducer\nWhen state logic becomes complex, useReducer provides better organization:\n// Define action types and reducer\nconst taskFormReducer = (state, action) =&gt; {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'SET_FIELD':\n      return {\n        ...state,\n        values: { ...state.values, [action.field]: action.value },\n        errors: { ...state.errors, [action.field]: null }\n      };\n\n    case 'SET_ERROR':\n      return {\n        ...state,\n        errors: { ...state.errors, [action.field]: action.error }\n      };\n\n    case 'SET_ERRORS':\n      return { ...state, errors: action.errors };\n\n    case 'SET_SUBMITTING':\n      return { ...state, isSubmitting: action.value };\n\n    case 'RESET':\n      return initialState;\n\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n};\n\nconst initialState = {\n  values: { title: '', description: '', priority: 'medium' },\n  errors: {},\n  isSubmitting: false\n};\n\nfunction TaskForm({ onSubmit }) {\n  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(taskFormReducer, initialState);\n\n  const handleChange = (field) =&gt; (e) =&gt; {\n    dispatch({ type: 'SET_FIELD', field, value: e.target.value });\n  };\n\n  const handleSubmit = async (e) =&gt; {\n    e.preventDefault();\n\n    // Validate\n    const errors = validateTaskForm(state.values);\n    if (Object.keys(errors).length &gt; 0) {\n      dispatch({ type: 'SET_ERRORS', errors });\n      return;\n    }\n\n    dispatch({ type: 'SET_SUBMITTING', value: true });\n    try {\n      await onSubmit(state.values);\n      dispatch({ type: 'RESET' });\n    } finally {\n      dispatch({ type: 'SET_SUBMITTING', value: false });\n    }\n  };\n\n  return (\n    &lt;form onSubmit={handleSubmit}&gt;\n      &lt;input\n        value={state.values.title}\n        onChange={handleChange('title')}\n        disabled={state.isSubmitting}\n      /&gt;\n      {state.errors.title && &lt;span&gt;{state.errors.title}&lt;/span&gt;}\n      {/* ... more fields */}\n      &lt;button disabled={state.isSubmitting}&gt;\n        {state.isSubmitting ? 'Saving...' : 'Create Task'}\n      &lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;/form&gt;\n  );\n}\n\n\nReact Context for Shared State\nContext provides a way to share state across the component tree without prop drilling:\n// AuthContext.jsx\nconst AuthContext = createContext(null);\n\nexport function AuthProvider({ children }) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n\n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\n    // Check for existing session on mount\n    checkAuthStatus().then(user =&gt; {\n      setUser(user);\n      setLoading(false);\n    });\n  }, []);\n\n  const login = async (credentials) =&gt; {\n    const user = await authApi.login(credentials);\n    setUser(user);\n    return user;\n  };\n\n  const logout = async () =&gt; {\n    await authApi.logout();\n    setUser(null);\n  };\n\n  const value = {\n    user,\n    isAuthenticated: !!user,\n    loading,\n    login,\n    logout\n  };\n\n  return (\n    &lt;AuthContext.Provider value={value}&gt;\n      {children}\n    &lt;/AuthContext.Provider&gt;\n  );\n}\n\n// Custom hook for consuming context\nexport function useAuth() {\n  const context = useContext(AuthContext);\n  if (!context) {\n    throw new Error('useAuth must be used within AuthProvider');\n  }\n  return context;\n}\n\n// Usage in components\nfunction UserMenu() {\n  const { user, logout, isAuthenticated } = useAuth();\n\n  if (!isAuthenticated) {\n    return &lt;LoginButton /&gt;;\n  }\n\n  return (\n    &lt;div className=\"user-menu\"&gt;\n      &lt;span&gt;Welcome, {user.name}&lt;/span&gt;\n      &lt;button onClick={logout}&gt;Logout&lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n}\n\n\nContext Best Practices\n1. Separate Contexts by Domain\n// Bad: One giant context\nconst AppContext = createContext({\n  user: null,\n  theme: 'light',\n  tasks: [],\n  notifications: [],\n  settings: {}\n});\n\n// Good: Separate contexts\nconst AuthContext = createContext(null);\nconst ThemeContext = createContext(null);\nconst NotificationContext = createContext(null);\n2. Optimize Re-renders\n// Problem: Any change re-renders all consumers\nconst TaskContext = createContext(null);\n\nfunction TaskProvider({ children }) {\n  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([]);\n  const [filter, setFilter] = useState('all');\n\n  // This object is recreated every render\n  const value = { tasks, filter, setTasks, setFilter };\n\n  return (\n    &lt;TaskContext.Provider value={value}&gt;\n      {children}\n    &lt;/TaskContext.Provider&gt;\n  );\n}\n\n// Solution: Memoize the value and split contexts\nfunction TaskProvider({ children }) {\n  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([]);\n  const [filter, setFilter] = useState('all');\n\n  const taskValue = useMemo(() =&gt; ({ tasks, setTasks }), [tasks]);\n  const filterValue = useMemo(() =&gt; ({ filter, setFilter }), [filter]);\n\n  return (\n    &lt;TaskStateContext.Provider value={taskValue}&gt;\n      &lt;TaskFilterContext.Provider value={filterValue}&gt;\n        {children}\n      &lt;/TaskFilterContext.Provider&gt;\n    &lt;/TaskStateContext.Provider&gt;\n  );\n}\n3. Provide Default Values for Testing\nconst ThemeContext = createContext({\n  theme: 'light',\n  toggleTheme: () =&gt; {}  // No-op default\n});\n\n// In tests, components work without provider\n// In app, provider overrides defaults\n\n\nState Management Libraries\nFor complex applications, dedicated state management libraries offer additional features.\n\nWhen to Use a Library\n\n\n\nScenario\nRecommendation\n\n\n\n\nSmall app, simple state\nuseState + Context\n\n\nMedium app, moderate complexity\nContext + useReducer\n\n\nLarge app, complex state\nConsider Zustand or Redux Toolkit\n\n\nHeavy server state caching\nTanStack Query (React Query)\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Zustand (Lightweight Alternative)\n// store/taskStore.js\nimport { create } from 'zustand';\n\nconst useTaskStore = create((set, get) =&gt; ({\n  tasks: [],\n  filter: 'all',\n  isLoading: false,\n\n  setTasks: (tasks) =&gt; set({ tasks }),\n\n  addTask: (task) =&gt; set((state) =&gt; ({\n    tasks: [task, ...state.tasks]\n  })),\n\n  updateTask: (id, updates) =&gt; set((state) =&gt; ({\n    tasks: state.tasks.map(t =&gt;\n      t.id === id ? { ...t, ...updates } : t\n    )\n  })),\n\n  deleteTask: (id) =&gt; set((state) =&gt; ({\n    tasks: state.tasks.filter(t =&gt; t.id !== id)\n  })),\n\n  setFilter: (filter) =&gt; set({ filter }),\n\n  // Derived state (selector)\n  getFilteredTasks: () =&gt; {\n    const { tasks, filter } = get();\n    switch (filter) {\n      case 'completed': return tasks.filter(t =&gt; t.completed);\n      case 'pending': return tasks.filter(t =&gt; !t.completed);\n      default: return tasks;\n    }\n  }\n}));\n\n// Usage in components\nfunction TaskList() {\n  const tasks = useTaskStore((state) =&gt; state.getFilteredTasks());\n  const deleteTask = useTaskStore((state) =&gt; state.deleteTask);\n\n  return (\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      {tasks.map(task =&gt; (\n        &lt;TaskItem\n          key={task.id}\n          task={task}\n          onDelete={() =&gt; deleteTask(task.id)}\n        /&gt;\n      ))}\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n  );\n}"

TaskDTO.fromDomain(t));\n  }\n}\n\n// Usage in controller\nres.json({\n  data: TaskDTO.fromDomainList(tasks),\n  meta: { total: tasks.length }\n});\n\n\nInput Validation\nValidate incoming data before processing:\n// validation/taskValidation.js\nconst Joi = require('joi');\n\nconst createTaskSchema = Joi.object({\n  title: Joi.string()\n    .min(1)\n    .max(200)\n    .required()\n    .messages({\n      'string.empty': 'Title is required',\n      'string.max': 'Title cannot exceed 200 characters'\n    }),\n\n  description: Joi.string()\n    .max(2000)\n    .optional(),\n\n  assigneeId: Joi.string()\n    .pattern(/^[a-f\\d]{24}$/i)  // MongoDB ObjectId\n    .optional(),\n\n  priority: Joi.string()\n    .valid('low', 'medium', 'high')\n    .default('medium')\n});\n\nconst updateTaskSchema = Joi.object({\n  title: Joi.string().min(1).max(200),\n  description: Joi.string().max(2000),\n  assigneeId: Joi.string().pattern(/^[a-f\\d]{24}$/i),\n  priority: Joi.string().valid('low', 'medium', 'high'),\n  status: Joi.string().valid('pending', 'in_progress', 'completed')\n}).min(1);

This week, we dive deeper into layered architecture—one of the most fundamental and widely-used patterns in software development. We’ll examine how layered architecture applies to both backend and frontend systems, with a particular focus on React application architecture.\nUnderstanding layered architecture is essential because it provides a framework for organizing code in a way that promotes maintainability, testability, and flexibility. Whether you’re building a simple CRUD application or a complex enterprise system, the principles of layered architecture will guide your design decisions."

    "text": "The Layered Architecture Pattern\n\nCore Principles\nLayered architecture divides an application into horizontal layers, each with a specific responsibility. The fundamental rules are:\n\nEach layer has a distinct responsibility - Layers should do one thing well\nDependencies flow downward - Upper layers depend on lower layers, never the reverse\nLayers communicate through interfaces - Each layer exposes a contract that upper layers consume\nImplementation details are hidden - Layers don’t expose how they accomplish their tasks\n\n\n\nThe Classic Four-Layer Model\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                     Presentation Layer                           │\n│         User Interface, Views, Controllers, API Endpoints        │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│                     Application Layer                            │\n│         Use Cases, Application Services, Orchestration           │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│                       Domain Layer                               │\n│         Business Logic, Entities, Domain Services, Rules         │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│                    Infrastructure Layer                          │\n│         Database, External APIs, File System, Messaging          │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\n\nLayer Responsibilities\n\nPresentation Layer\nThe presentation layer handles all user interaction. In a web application, this includes:\n\nUser Interface Components - React components, HTML templates\nControllers/Routes - Express route handlers, API endpoints\nView Models/DTOs - Data shapes optimized for display\nInput Validation - Basic validation of user input format\n\n// Express route handler (Presentation Layer)\nrouter.get('/api/tasks/:id', async (req, res) =&gt; {\n  try {\n    const task = await taskService.getTaskById(req.params.id);\n    res.json(TaskDTO.fromDomain(task));\n  } catch (error) {\n    if (error instanceof NotFoundError) {\n      return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Task not found' });\n    }\n    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });\n  }\n});\nThe presentation layer should be thin—it transforms input, calls the application layer, and transforms output. It contains no business logic.\n\n\nApplication Layer\nThe application layer orchestrates the application’s use cases. It:\n\nCoordinates workflows - Manages the sequence of operations\nEnforces application rules - Rules that aren’t core business logic\nHandles transactions - Manages unit-of-work boundaries\nTransforms data - Converts between domain and presentation formats\n\n// Application Service (Application Layer)\nclass TaskService {\n  constructor(taskRepository, notificationService, eventBus) {\n    this.taskRepository = taskRepository;\n    this.notificationService = notificationService;\n    this.eventBus = eventBus;\n  }\n\n  async completeTask(taskId, userId) {\n    // Retrieve domain entity\n    const task = await this.taskRepository.findById(taskId);\n    if (!task) {\n      throw new NotFoundError('Task');\n    }\n\n    // Verify authorization (application rule)\n    if (task.assigneeId !== userId) {\n      throw new UnauthorizedError('Only assignee can complete task');\n    }\n\n    // Execute domain logic\n    task.complete();\n\n    // Persist changes\n    await this.taskRepository.save(task);\n\n    // Trigger side effects\n    await this.notificationService.notifyTaskCompleted(task);\n    this.eventBus.publish(new TaskCompletedEvent(task));\n\n    return task;\n  }\n}\n\n\nDomain Layer\nThe domain layer contains the core business logic—the rules that define what your application does, independent of any technical concerns:\n\nEntities - Objects with identity that encapsulate business rules\nValue Objects - Immutable objects defined by their attributes\nDomain Services - Operations that don’t belong to a single entity\nBusiness Rules - Invariants and constraints\n\n// Domain Entity (Domain Layer)\nclass Task {\n  constructor({ id, title, description, status, assigneeId, priority }) {\n    this.id = id;\n    this.title = title;\n    this.description = description;\n    this.status = status || 'pending';\n    this.assigneeId = assigneeId;\n    this.priority = priority || 'medium';\n    this.completedAt = null;\n  }\n\n  complete() {\n    if (this.status === 'completed') {\n      throw new DomainError('Task is already completed');\n    }\n    this.status = 'completed';\n    this.completedAt = new Date();\n  }\n\n  isHighPriority() {\n    return this.priority === 'high' && this.status !== 'completed';\n  }\n\n  reassign(newAssigneeId) {\n    if (this.status === 'completed') {\n      throw new DomainError('Cannot reassign completed task');\n    }\n    this.assigneeId = newAssigneeId;\n  }\n}\nThe domain layer should have no dependencies on other layers or external frameworks. It’s pure business logic.\n\n\nInfrastructure Layer\nThe infrastructure layer handles all external concerns:\n\nDatabase Access - Repository implementations\nExternal Services - API clients, email services\nFile System - File storage and retrieval\nMessaging - Message queues, event buses\n\n// Repository Implementation (Infrastructure Layer)\nclass MongoTaskRepository {\n  constructor(mongoClient) {\n    this.collection = mongoClient.db('app').collection('tasks');\n  }\n\n  async findById(id) {\n    const doc = await this.collection.findOne({ _id: new ObjectId(id) });\n    return doc ? this.toDomain(doc) : null;\n  }\n\n  async save(task) {\n    const doc = this.toDocument(task);\n    await this.collection.updateOne(\n      { _id: new ObjectId(task.id) },\n      { $set: doc },\n      { upsert: true }\n    );\n    return task;\n  }\n\n  toDomain(doc) {\n    return new Task({\n      id: doc._id.toString(),\n      title: doc.title,\n      description: doc.description,\n      status: doc.status,\n      assigneeId: doc.assigneeId,\n      dueDate: doc.dueDate,\n      completedAt: doc.completedAt\n    });\n  }\n\n  toDocument(task) {\n    return {\n      title: task.title,\n      description: task.description,\n      status: task.status,\n      assigneeId: task.assigneeId,\n      dueDate: task.dueDate,\n      completedAt: task.completedAt\n    };\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nBenefits of Layered Architecture\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenefit\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nSeparation of Concerns\nEach layer focuses on one aspect of the application\n\n\nTestability\nLayers can be tested in isolation with mocks\n\n\nFlexibility\nImplementations can be swapped without affecting other layers\n\n\nMaintainability\nChanges are localized to specific layers\n\n\nTeam Scalability\nDifferent teams can work on different layers\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon Pitfalls\n1. Leaking Abstractions\nWhen implementation details from lower layers appear in upper layers:\n// Bad: MongoDB-specific code in presentation layer\nrouter.get('/tasks', async (req, res) =&gt; {\n  const tasks = await Task.find({ status: { $ne: 'deleted' } })\n    .sort({ createdAt: -1 })\n    .populate('assignee');  // MongoDB-specific\n  res.json(tasks);\n});\n\n// Good: Layer-agnostic code\nrouter.get('/tasks', async (req, res) =&gt; {\n  const tasks = await taskService.getActiveTasks();\n  res.json(tasks.map(TaskDTO.fromDomain));\n});\n2. Anemic Domain Model\nWhen entities are just data holders with no behavior:\n// Bad: Anemic entity\nclass Task {\n  constructor(data) {\n    this.id = data.id;\n    this.title = data.title;\n    this.status = data.status;\n  }\n}\n\n// Business logic scattered in services\nclass TaskService {\n  complete(task) {\n    if (task.status === 'completed') throw new Error('Already completed');\n    task.status = 'completed';\n    task.completedAt = new Date();\n  }\n}\n\n// Good: Rich domain model\nclass Task {\n  complete() {\n    if (this.status === 'completed') {\n      throw new DomainError('Task is already completed');\n    }\n    this.status = 'completed';\n    this.completedAt = new Date();\n  }\n}\n3. God Services\nWhen a single service handles too many responsibilities:\n// Bad: God service\nclass ApplicationService {\n  createUser() { /* ... */ }\n  deleteUser() { /* ... */ }\n  createTask() { /* ... */ }\n  assignTask() { /* ... */ }\n  sendEmail() { /* ... */ }\n  generateReport() { /* ... */ }\n}\n\n// Good: Focused services\nclass UserService { /* user operations */ }\nclass TaskService { /* task operations */ }\nclass ReportService { /* reporting operations */ }"

While the layers look different from backend applications, the principles are the same.\n\nFrontend Layer Model\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                     Presentation Layer                           │\n│              UI Components, Styling, Layout                      │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│                     Container Layer                              │\n│         State Connection, Data Fetching, Event Handling          │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│                     State Management Layer                       │\n│         Application State, Actions, Reducers, Selectors          │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│                     Service/API Layer                            │\n│              API Clients, Data Transformation                    │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\n\nPresentation Components\nPresentation components (also called “dumb” or “pure” components) focus solely on rendering UI:\n// Presentation Component\nfunction TaskCard({ task, onComplete, onDelete }) {\n  return (\n    &lt;div className={`task-card ${task.completed ? 'completed' : ''}`}&gt;\n      &lt;h3&gt;{task.title}&lt;/h3&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;{task.description}&lt;/p&gt;\n      {task.dueDate && (\n        &lt;span className=\"due-date\"&gt;\n          Due: {formatDate(task.dueDate)}\n        &lt;/span&gt;\n      )}\n      &lt;div className=\"actions\"&gt;\n        {!task.completed && (\n          &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; onComplete(task.id)}&gt;\n            Complete\n          &lt;/button&gt;\n        )}\n        &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; onDelete(task.id)}&gt;\n          Delete\n        &lt;/button&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n}\nCharacteristics of presentation components: - Receive data and callbacks via props - No direct state management or API calls - Highly reusable and testable - Easy to develop in isolation (Storybook)\n\n\nContainer Components\nContainer components (also called “smart” components) handle data and behavior:\n// Container Component\nfunction TaskListContainer() {\n  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([]);\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n  const [error, setError] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\n    loadTasks();\n  }, []);\n\n  const loadTasks = async () =&gt; {\n    try {\n      setLoading(true);\n      const data = await taskApi.getTasks();\n      setTasks(data);\n    } catch (err) {\n      setError(err.message);\n    } finally {\n      setLoading(false);\n    }\n  };\n\n  const handleComplete = async (taskId) =&gt; {\n    try {\n      const updated = await taskApi.completeTask(taskId);\n      setTasks(tasks.map(t =&gt; t.id === taskId ?

    "text": "Introduction\nLast week we established the technical foundation for containerized development. This week, we shift focus to architectural thinking—the skill of decomposing complex systems into well-defined components and making informed decisions about how those components interact.\nArchitecture is not about following rigid rules or applying trendy patterns. It’s about understanding trade-offs and making decisions that serve your project’s specific needs. A well-architected system is easier to understand, test, modify, and scale. A poorly architected system becomes increasingly difficult to work with over time, accumulating what we call technical debt.\nThis reading covers three interconnected topics: architectural patterns that have proven useful across many projects, strategies for decomposing systems into manageable components, and techniques for scoping projects effectively."

    "section": "What is Software Architecture?",
    "text": "What is Software Architecture?\n\nDefining Architecture\nSoftware architecture refers to the fundamental structures of a software system and the discipline of creating such structures. It encompasses:\n\nHigh-level structure: How the system is divided into components\nComponent interactions: How those components communicate\nDesign decisions: The significant choices that shape the system\nQuality attributes: The non-functional requirements like performance, security, and maintainability\n\nArchitecture is distinct from design. While design focuses on the details of individual components, architecture focuses on the relationships between components and the overall system structure.\n\n\nWhy Architecture Matters\nConsider two teams building similar applications. Team A jumps straight into coding, adding features as needed. Team B spends time upfront thinking about structure, defining clear boundaries between components, and documenting key decisions.\nInitially, Team A moves faster. But as the application grows:\n\nTeam A struggles to add features without breaking existing functionality\nTeam A’s codebase becomes difficult for new developers to understand\nTeam A spends increasing time debugging unexpected interactions\nTeam A finds it hard to scale specific components independently\n\nMeanwhile, Team B:\n\nCan add features by working within well-defined boundaries\nOnboards new developers quickly because the structure is clear\nIsolates bugs more easily due to clear component boundaries\nCan scale individual components based on demand\n\nThe time invested in architecture pays dividends throughout the project lifecycle.\n\n\nArchitecture Decision Records (ADRs)\nExperienced teams document significant architectural decisions using Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). An ADR captures:\n\nContext: What situation prompted this decision?\nDecision: What did we decide to do?\nConsequences: What are the trade-offs of this decision?\n\nExample ADR:\n# ADR 001: Use MongoDB for Primary Data Store\n\n## Context\nWe need to choose a database for our task management application.\nThe data model includes tasks with varying attributes depending on\ntask type. We expect frequent schema changes during development.\n\n## Decision\nWe will use MongoDB as our primary data store.\n\n## Consequences\n### Positive\n- Flexible schema accommodates varying task attributes\n- Easy schema evolution during development\n- Native JSON support simplifies API development\n- Horizontal scaling through sharding when needed\n\n### Negative\n- No enforced referential integrity\n- Complex queries may require aggregation pipelines\n- Team has less MongoDB experience than PostgreSQL\n- Need to implement data validation in application layer\nADRs create a historical record that helps current and future team members understand why the system is structured as it is.\nFor additional information see links to the Github ADR resource, AWS resources, and Microsoft."

    "text": "Foundational Architectural Patterns\nPatterns are reusable solutions to common problems. They provide a shared vocabulary for discussing architecture and help teams avoid reinventing solutions to solved problems.\n\nClient-Server Pattern\nThe client-server pattern separates concerns between service requesters (clients) and service providers (servers). This fundamental pattern underlies virtually all web applications.\n┌─────────────────┐         HTTP/HTTPS        ┌─────────────────┐\n│                 │  ───────────────────────► │                 │\n│     Client      │                           │     Server      │\n│   (Browser)     │  ◄─────────────────────── │     (API)       │\n│                 │         Response          │                 │\n└─────────────────┘                           └─────────────────┘\nCharacteristics: - Clients initiate requests; servers respond - Servers can serve multiple clients simultaneously - Clients and servers can evolve independently (given stable APIs) - Network communication introduces latency and failure modes\nIn our MERN stack: - React frontend = Client - Express API = Server - The browser makes HTTP requests to the API - The API processes requests and returns JSON responses\n\n\nLayered Architecture Pattern\nThe layered architecture pattern organizes code into horizontal layers, each with a specific responsibility. Each layer only communicates with adjacent layers.\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                    Presentation Layer                        │\n│              (UI Components, Views, Controllers)             │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│                    Application Layer                         │\n│              (Use Cases, Application Logic)                  │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│                      Domain Layer                            │\n│              (Business Logic, Entities, Rules)               │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│                   Infrastructure Layer                       │\n│              (Database, External Services, I/O)              │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\nLayer Responsibilities:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLayer\nResponsibility\nExample Components\n\n\n\n\nPresentation\nHandle user interaction\nReact components, Express routes\n\n\nApplication\nOrchestrate use cases\nService classes, controllers\n\n\nDomain\nBusiness rules and logic\nEntity classes, validation rules\n\n\nInfrastructure\nExternal system integration\nDatabase repositories, API clients\n\n\n\nKey Rules: 1. Dependencies point downward (presentation depends on application, not vice versa) 2. Each layer only knows about the layer directly below it 3. The domain layer should have no external dependencies\nBenefits: - Separation of concerns: Each layer has a clear purpose - Testability: Layers can be tested in isolation - Flexibility: Layers can be modified without affecting others - Reusability: Lower layers can be reused across applications\n\n\nModel-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern\nMVC separates an application into three interconnected components:\n         User Input\n              │\n              ▼\n        ┌───────────┐\n        │Controller │ ──────────────┐\n        └───────────┘               │\n              │                     │\n              │ Updates             │ Manipulates\n              ▼                     ▼\n        ┌───────────┐         ┌───────────┐\n        │   View    │ ◄────── │   Model   │\n        └───────────┘  Reads  └───────────┘\n              │\n              ▼\n         User Output\nComponents:\n\nModel: Manages data, business logic, and rules\nView: Presents data to the user\nController: Handles user input and updates Model/View\n\nIn Express.js:\n// Model (models/Task.js)\nconst taskSchema = new mongoose.Schema({\n  title: { type: String, required: true },\n  completed: { type: Boolean, default: false }\n});\n\n// Controller (controllers/taskController.js)\nexports.getTasks = async (req, res) =&gt; {\n  const tasks = await Task.find();\n  res.json(tasks);\n};\n\n// View/Route (routes/tasks.js)\nrouter.get('/', taskController.getTasks);\nIn React: React modifies the traditional MVC pattern. Components combine View and Controller concerns, while state (local or global) serves as the Model.\n\n\nRepository Pattern\nThe repository pattern abstracts data access behind a collection-like interface. This separates business logic from data access concerns.\n// Without Repository (business logic coupled to database)\nasync function completeTask(taskId) {\n  const task = await mongoose.model('Task').findById(taskId);\n  task.completed = true;\n  task.completedAt = new Date();\n  await task.save();\n  return task;\n}\n\n// With Repository (business logic decoupled)\nclass TaskRepository {\n  async findById(id) {\n    return await Task.findById(id);\n  }\n\n  async save(task) {\n    return await task.save();\n  }\n}\n\nasync function completeTask(taskId, taskRepository) {\n  const task = await taskRepository.findById(taskId);\n  task.completed = true;\n  task.completedAt = new Date();\n  return await taskRepository.save(task);\n}\nBenefits: - Business logic doesn’t know about MongoDB, making it testable - Database can be swapped without changing business logic - Data access logic is centralized and reusable\n\n\nMiddleware Pattern\nThe middleware pattern chains processing functions, where each function can modify the request/response or pass control to the next function.\nRequest ──► [Auth] ──► [Logging] ──► [Validation] ──► [Handler] ──► Response\n              │            │              │\n              ▼            ▼              ▼\n           Reject       Log data      Reject if\n          if invalid                   invalid\nExpress middleware example:\n// Authentication middleware\nconst authenticate = (req, res, next) =&gt; {\n  const token = req.headers.authorization;\n  if (!token) {\n    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'No token provided' });\n  }\n  try {\n    req.user = verifyToken(token);\n    next(); // Pass to next middleware\n  } catch (error) {\n    res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid token' });\n  }\n};\n\n// Logging middleware\nconst logRequest = (req, res, next) =&gt; {\n  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.path} at ${new Date().toISOString()}`);\n  next();\n};\n\n// Apply middleware\napp.use(logRequest);\napp.use('/api', authenticate);\nCharacteristics: - Each middleware has a single responsibility - Middleware can short-circuit the chain (e.g., authentication failure) - Order matters—middleware executes in registration order - Promotes code reuse across routes"

    "section": "System Decomposition",
    "text": "System Decomposition\nDecomposition is the process of breaking a complex system into smaller, manageable parts. Good decomposition creates components that are:\n\nCohesive: Each component has a focused purpose\nLoosely coupled: Components have minimal dependencies on each other\nWell-encapsulated: Internal details are hidden behind interfaces\n\n\nDecomposition Strategies\n\nBy Feature/Domain\nOrganize code around business capabilities or features:\nsrc/\n├── tasks/\n│   ├── taskController.js\n│   ├── taskService.js\n│   ├── taskRepository.js\n│   └── taskModel.js\n├── users/\n│   ├── userController.js\n│   ├── userService.js\n│   ├── userRepository.js\n│   └── userModel.js\n└── projects/\n    ├── projectController.js\n    ├── projectService.js\n    ├── projectRepository.js\n    └── projectModel.js\nAdvantages: - Related code is co-located - Features can be developed independently - Easier to understand feature scope - Natural boundaries for team ownership\n\n\nBy Layer\nOrganize code by technical responsibility:\nsrc/\n├── controllers/\n│   ├── taskController.js\n│   ├── userController.js\n│   └── projectController.js\n├── services/\n│   ├── taskService.js\n│   ├── userService.js\n│   └── projectService.js\n├── repositories/\n│   ├── taskRepository.js\n│   ├── userRepository.js\n│   └── projectRepository.js\n└── models/\n    ├── Task.js\n    ├── User.js\n    └── Project.js\nAdvantages: - Clear separation of concerns - Easy to enforce layer rules - Familiar to developers from traditional architectures\n\n\nHybrid Approach\nMany projects combine both strategies:\nsrc/\n├── features/\n│   ├── tasks/\n│   │   ├── controller.js\n│   │   ├── service.js\n│   │   └── repository.js\n│   └── users/\n│       ├── controller.js\n│       ├── service.js\n│       └── repository.js\n├── shared/\n│   ├── middleware/\n│   ├── utils/\n│   └── errors/\n└── infrastructure/\n    ├── database/\n    └── external-apis/\n\n\n\nCoupling and Cohesion\nCoupling measures how dependent components are on each other. Lower coupling is generally better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoupling Type\nDescription\nExample\n\n\n\n\nContent\nOne component modifies another’s internals\nDirectly accessing private variables\n\n\nCommon\nComponents share global data\nGlobal configuration objects\n\n\nControl\nOne component controls another’s flow\nPassing flags to control behavior\n\n\nData\nComponents share data through parameters\nFunction parameters, API payloads\n\n\nMessage\nComponents communicate through messages\nEvent systems, message queues\n\n\n\nCohesion measures how related the elements within a component are. Higher cohesion is generally better.\n\n\n\nCohesion Type\nDescription\nQuality\n\n\n\n\nFunctional\nAll elements contribute to a single task\nBest\n\n\nSequential\nOutput of one element is input to next\nGood\n\n\nCommunicational\nElements operate on same data\nAcceptable\n\n\nLogical\nElements are related by category\nPoor\n\n\nCoincidental\nElements are unrelated\nWorst\n\n\n\nExample of improving cohesion:\n// Low cohesion: Utility class doing unrelated things\nclass Utils {\n  static formatDate(date) { /* ... */ }\n  static validateEmail(email) { /* ... */ }\n  static calculateTax(amount) { /* ... */ }\n  static hashPassword(password) { /* ... */ }\n}\n\n// High cohesion: Focused classes\nclass DateFormatter {\n  static format(date, pattern) { /* ... */ }\n  static parse(dateString, pattern) { /* ... */ }\n}\n\nclass EmailValidator {\n  static isValid(email) { /* ... */ }\n  static normalize(email) { /* ... */ }\n}\n\nclass TaxCalculator {\n  static calculate(amount, jurisdiction) { /* ... */ }\n}\n\nclass PasswordHasher {\n  static hash(password) { /* ... */ }\n  static verify(password, hash) { /* ... */ }\n}\n\n\nDefining Component Boundaries\nGood boundaries make systems easier to understand and modify. Consider these guidelines:\n1. Single Responsibility Each component should have one reason to change. If you find yourself saying “this component handles X and Y,” consider splitting it.\n2. Information Hiding Components should expose only what’s necessary. Internal implementation details should be hidden.\n// Exposed: What it does\nclass TaskService {\n  async createTask(data) { /* ... */ }\n  async completeTask(id) { /* ... */ }\n  async getTasksByUser(userId) { /* ... */ }\n}\n\n// Hidden: How it does it\n// - Database queries\n// - Caching strategies\n// - Validation details\n// - Event emission\n3. Stable Interfaces Interfaces between components should change less frequently than implementations. Design interfaces around what needs to happen, not how it happens.\n4. Dependency Direction Dependencies should point toward stability. Stable, core components should not depend on volatile, peripheral components.\n┌─────────────────┐\n│   UI Components │  ← Changes frequently\n└────────┬────────┘\n         │ depends on\n         ▼\n┌─────────────────┐\n│    Services     │  ← Changes occasionally\n└────────┬────────┘\n         │ depends on\n         ▼\n┌─────────────────┐\n│  Domain Models  │  ← Changes rarely\n└─────────────────┘"

Well-designed APIs make systems easier to use, maintain, and evolve.\n\nRESTful API Design\nREST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for networked applications.

In your project, you’ll apply these patterns and make architectural decisions that you’ll document and defend."

Students will examine architectural and design patterns that underlie contemporary web platforms, emphasizing system decomposition, data flow, scalability, reliability, and security.\nThe course adopts a full-stack perspective, integrating modern frontend frameworks, backend services, databases, and APIs into cohesive and maintainable applications. Core technologies include HTML5/CSS3, JavaScript-based frontend frameworks, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and related tooling. Students will also explore user experience design, data modeling, and performance considerations that influence real-world application behavior.\nIn addition, the course introduces intelligent and automated system components, including AI-assisted development workflows and agent-based automation, and examines how such capabilities can be safely and effectively incorporated into web applications. Emphasis is placed on testing, containerization, continuous integration and deployment, and cloud-based deployment and scaling using contemporary platforms and practices.\nThe course is lab-intensive and project-driven, with students working collaboratively to design, build, deploy, and present a full-stack web application."

If TaskItem could modify its own state, we’d have copies of data in multiple places that could get out of sync.\nTaskItem is “dumb”: It only knows how to display a task and call a function when clicked. It doesn’t know about other tasks or how to update the array.\nReusability: TaskItem can be used anywhere. It just needs title, completed, and onToggle props.\nData flows down, events flow up:\n\nApp passes data DOWN to TaskItem via props\nTaskItem sends events UP by calling onToggle\nApp handles the event and updates state\nReact re-renders with new data\n\n\nThe alternative (and why it’s bad):\n// DON'T DO THIS - TaskItem managing its own state\nfunction TaskItem({ title, initialCompleted }) {\n  const [completed, setCompleted] = useState(initialCompleted)\n  // Now TaskItem has its own copy of completed\n  // This gets out of sync with the parent's data!\n}"

This mental model will make everything else in this lab—and later in Next.js—much easier to understand.\n\n\n\nWhat Is a React Component?\nAt its core:\n\nA React component is just a JavaScript function that returns UI.\n\nExample:\nfunction Greeting() {\n  return &lt;h2&gt;Welcome to React Basics!&lt;/h2&gt;\n}\nThis is not a template or special syntax. It is a normal JavaScript function.\nWhen React sees &lt;Greeting /&gt; in your code, it:\n\nCalls the Greeting() function\nTakes the JSX it returns\nDisplays that JSX on the screen\n\nYou can think of this as:\nGreeting()\nproducing UI.\n\n\nComponents Are Re-Executed on Every Render\nA critical mental model in React is this:\n\nReact re-runs your component function every time state changes.\n\nFor example:\nfunction App() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n  return &lt;p&gt;Count: {count}&lt;/p&gt;\n}\nWhen setCount() is called:\n\nReact stores the new state\nReact re-runs App()\nReact compares the old UI to the new UI\nOnly the changed parts of the DOM are updated\n\nThis is why:\n\nYou never manually update the DOM\nUI is always a function of state\n\n\n\nWhy Component Names Must Be Capitalized\nReact uses capitalization to distinguish components from HTML.\n&lt;Greeting /&gt;   // React component → calls Greeting()\n&lt;greeting /&gt;   // HTML element → looks for &lt;greeting&gt; tag\nRule:\n\nCapital letter → React component\nLowercase → HTML element\n\n\n\nProps vs State\n\n\n\nConcept\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nProps\nData passed into a component\n\n\nState\nData managed inside a component\n\n\nProps\nRead-only\n\n\nState\nCan change over time\n\n\n\n\n\nData Flow in React\n\nData flows down, events flow up\n\nParents pass data to children via props. Children notify parents of events via callback functions. Parents update state. React re-renders the UI."
